1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,470
我刚买下了这房子 我要把它送给钱德勒（Chandler）
I just bought this house, and I'm gonna give it to Chandler.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,138
-真的吗？-假的
-Really? - No.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,141
但是 我要把它给一个送披萨的小哥 方式是这样的
But, I am gonna give it to a pizza delivery guy, and here's how.

4
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,275
我们点了披萨
We ordered a pizza.

5
00:00:09,275 --> 00:00:10,710
达美乐披萨饼 我能为您效劳吗？
Domino's Pizza, how can I help you?

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,612
我可以要一个意大利香肠披萨吗？ 请送货
Can I have a pepperoni? Delivery, please.

7
00:00:12,612 --> 00:00:16,616
然后我们雇了一个披萨小哥帮我们搬了一整天家具
Then we paid a pizza delivery guy to help us move furniture all day.

8
00:00:16,616 --> 00:00:18,284
我们只是需要帮忙搬家具
We just need help moving furniture.

9
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,786
如果我们给你几千美元
If we were to give you a few thousand dollars,

10
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:21,287
你能帮我们搬一整天家具吗？
could you just help us move furniture all day?

11
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:22,255
-当然 -真的吗？
-Sure. -Really?

12
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:26,159
我们只告诉他 我们是UP主 需要一个帮手帮忙搬家具
All we told him is that we are YouTubers and we needed an extra hand moving furniture.

13
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:29,162
因为我们的朋友查德（Chad）被解雇了 我们真的很想帮助他
Because our friend Chad got laid off, and we really wanted to help him.

14
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,264
但他不知道 查德不是真的
But little does he know, Chad isn't real.

15
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,667
最终我们会给他100%的房子所有权
At the end of the day we would actually give him 100% ownership of the house

16
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,337
就是他在帮我们搬家具的这座房子
he is helping us move furniture into.

17
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,639
-傻了吧！ -恶作剧成功
-Pranked! -Got him.

18
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,175
令人惊讶的是 他竟然同意了
Surprisingly, he's going along with it.

19
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,778
他以为他只得到几千美元
All he thinks he's getting is a few thousand dollars.

20
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:49,082
把所有家具搬进去后 我们会说 “这把钥匙是你的了”
After we move all the furniture in, we're just gonna be like, "This key is yours. "

21
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:50,650
好的 去沃尔玛
All right, to Walmart it is.

22
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,221
我们只是想填满他的房子
We're trying to just fill his house.

23
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,456
所以买家具
So furniture.

24
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,557
我们从卧室开始吧
So let's start in the bedroom.

25
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:58,758
哦 小宝贝
Oh, baby.

26
00:00:58,758 --> 00:00:59,959
你觉得这样的椅子怎么样？
What do you think of a chair like this?

27
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:00,794
很大气
It's assertive.

28
00:01:00,794 --> 00:01:02,128
哦 还有充气腰椎
Oh, and it's got air lumbar.

29
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,097
查德的腰部确实需要一些空气
Chad's lumbar do be needin' air.

30
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,900
很好
Good grief.

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,835
钱德勒 你觉得这个怎么样？
Chandler, what do you think of this?

32
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,770
哇哦 你们都听到了吗？
Whoo-hoo, did you all hear that?

33
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,539
乔伊（Joey） 你能给我们做个爆震测试吗？
Joey, can you give us the knock test?

34
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:14,974
很好
Yeah.

35
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,643
如你所见 这就是我们带乔伊来的原因
See you guys, this is why we brought Joey.

36
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:17,577
他非常有帮助
He's incredibly helpful.

37
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,946
实际上我刚给我妈妈买了这台电视
I actually just bought my mom this TV.

38
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:20,780
你觉得怎么样 乔伊？
What do you think of it, Joey?

39
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,148
这是一台很好的电视机
It's a nice TV.

40
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:22,982
我们来吧
Let's do it.

41
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:28,521
我们有一台电视 一个书架 还有一把椅子
We have a TV, we have a bookstand, and we have a chair.

42
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:29,689
我们再拿一台电视机
Let's grab another TV.

43
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,257
这个里面有Roku
This one has Roku in it.

44
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:33,927
我想我们可以走了
I think we're good to go.

45
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,496
他是我们多米诺披萨饼的人
He's our Domino's guy.

46
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,363
我们只是带他到处走
We just bring him everywhere.

47
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,266
你觉得你今天会做这种事吗？
Did you think you would be doing this today?

48
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,134
不 我不觉得
No, I didn't.

49
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:42,102
-一点都没有？ -是的
-At all? -No.

50
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,238
所以总共是$2360美元 比我想象的要少
So the total is 2, 360 dollars. Way less than I thought.

51
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,539
所以我们把家具买好了
So we got the furniture sort of done.

52
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,909
-是啊 -好吧 我们有辆U-Haul为查德的房子运送
-Yeah. -All right, we got a U-Haul for this stuff for Chad's house.

53
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,713
-哇哦 -啊！
-Whoosh. -Ahh!

54
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,119
看 这就是我们带你来的原因 乔伊
See, this is why we brought you, Joey.

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,321
在这一天中 只要乔伊告诉我们他喜欢的东西
Throughout the day, anytime Joey told us he liked something,

56
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:04,791
我会去另一个走道 我会打电话给杰克并告诉他
I would go to a different aisle, and I'd call Jake and tell him.

57
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:08,595
杰克负责秘密买东西 所以当乔伊对房子感到惊讶的时候
Jake was in charge of covertly buying stuff so when we surprised Joey with the house,

58
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,764
我们也可以在里面放一些其他很酷的东西 这对他也很重要
we could have all this other cool stuff that means a lot to him in there as well.

59
00:02:11,764 --> 00:02:12,599
吉米（Jimmy）来电
Jimmy's calling me.

60
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,399
嘿 怎么了 老弟？
Hey, what's up, buddy?

61
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,802
我和他一起坐了车 得到了一些情报
Hey, so I rode with him in the car and I got some intel.

62
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,636
好 你有什么发现？
Okay, what you got?

63
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,506
我要你给他买一部最新的iPhone 一堆汪星人的东西
I need you to get him the newest iPhone, a bunch of stuff for dogs,

64
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:23,042
然后他在手机上贴了一个怪物贴纸 所以给他来一千个
and then he had a Monster sticker on his phone, so get him like a thousand.

65
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:23,877
来一千个
Get him a thousand.

66
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,145
-一千？ -好的 准备好了吗 马库斯（Marcus）？
-A thousand? -All right, you ready, Marcus?

67
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,079

00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,913
开工

我们有肉汁骨头
We got the Gravy bone.

70
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,983
嘿 朋友们 我们有猫粮
Hey guys, we got the cat food.

71
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,418
-他说他需要猫食 对吧？ -他有一条狗
-He said he needed cat food, right? -He has a dog.

72
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:35,455
-哦 -他想啥呢？
-Oooh. -What was he thinking?

73
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,157
我们怎么才能弄一千个怪物？
How are we gonna get a thousand Monster?

74
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,625
装起来！
Load it up!

75
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:40,527
我们把它们都弄过来
Let's get all of 'em.

76
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,162
非常重要的情报 你准备好了吗？
Very important intel, are you ready?

77
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,163
是的 待命中
Yes, we're ready.

78
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,964
他有个三岁的女儿 给她买很多玩具

79
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:46,399
哦 太好了 谢谢讯息

Despite the fact that you are like ginormous and scary, you'rethe perfect guy for this.

81
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,004
再见 再见

82
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:51,838
再见
Bye.

83
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:55,241
我们是给她买个游戏室 还是给她买辆很酷的汽车?
Do we get her a playhouse, or do we get her one of the really cool motorized cars?

84
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,709
两个都买就不会有问题了
You can't go wrong with getting both.

85
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:57,744
很好 那我们两个都要买！
Well, let's do both then!

86
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,546
我觉得他有点过火了
I think he's going a little overboard.

87
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,114
盲推
Driving blind.

88
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:03,183
我们在二号店 更多的家具
We're at store number two, some more furniture.

89
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,417
克里斯 这看起来不错

00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,553
-皮革？ -哦 我喜欢这个
-Leather? -Oooh, I like this.

91
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:09,222
-俯冲感觉如何？ -一点也不疼

92
00:03:09,222 --> 00:03:10,490
这两样我都要
I want both these.

93
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,325
哦 是的 这个好多了
Oh yeah, this one's a lot better.

94
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,494
一切都很顺利 他完全不知道
This is going so well, he has no idea.

95
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:18,531
记住 现在他正在帮我们挑选他自己家的家具
Remember, right now he's helping us pick out furniture for his own house.

96
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,933
你觉得这整件事怎么样？
So what do you think about this whole thing?

97
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,435
我觉得你们都在帮这个人挺酷的
I think it's kinda cool that you all are helping this man.

98
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:25,638
所以接下来 显然 我们需要一张床给查德
So next up, obviously, we need a bed for Chad.

99
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,273
-哦！ -好的 我要了

102
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:35,315

他们应该开心 我们有很多好东西 兄弟
They should be, we got a lot of good stuff, bro.

108
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,493
你最好别掉了 孩子
What are you doin' better not fall, boy.

109
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,595
完事了吗？
Is that it?

110
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,629
完事了
That's it.

111
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,663
离开吧
Let's get out of here.

112
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:53,132
我们现在在US Cellular 因为我们不能在沃尔玛直接买到手机
We're now at US Cellular because we could not buy a phone outright at Walmart.

113
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,767
所以我们可以给他一个惊喜 买个新手机
So we can surprise him with a new phone.

114
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:57,637
我们正在做一个视频 我们要用一个全新的iPhone 11给一个家伙一个惊喜
We're doing a video, and we're gonna surprise a guy with a brand new iPhone 11.

115
00:03:57,637 --> 00:03:59,672
这里的一切都很酷
Everything here, it is cool.

116
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,507
太棒了 非常感谢你们
Awesome, thank you all so much.

117
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:04,077
乔伊正在喝咖啡 他绕了一小段路
So Joey's currently getting coffee, he took a little detour,

118
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,411
所以我们要在没有他的情况下买点东西
so we're gonna shop a little without him.

119
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,814
乔伊回来之前 你们觉得怎么样？
Before Joey gets back here, how do you guys think it's going?

120
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:08,715
我觉得一切都很顺利
I think it's going good.

121
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,617
-他不知道 -他完全没有注意
-He has no idea. -He has no idea.

122
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,751
不 你觉得他会哭吗？
No, you think he'll cry?

123
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:12,585
-希望如此 -我可能会哭
-I hope so. -I might cry.

124
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,786
我想他会流泪的
I think he's gonna break out into tears.

125
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:15,655
所以你说你还没有花足够的钱 对吧？
So you said you hadn't spent enough money yet, right?

126
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:16,623
我们几乎什么都没花
We've spent hardly anything.

127
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,725
好吧 你要在这里砸一大笔钱了
Well, you're about to drop a lot of money here.

128
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:19,559
我赌你
I dare you.

129
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,627
我们要一套美泰设施
We want the set of the Maytags.

130
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:23,363
我们可以买这个 上面有个平板
We can get this one, it's got a tablet on it.

131
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,300
我在沙雕东西上花了成千上万美元 但这个看起来也太过分了
I blow hundreds of thousands of dollars on dumb stuff, but even this seems excessive.

132
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,268
里面有个扬声器
It's got a speaker in it.

133
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,836
不要紧 这就解释通了 我们要了
Never mind, that explains it, let's get it.

134
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,971

You were $1, 500 but you're on discount.

137
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,644
是的 因为我的内心有点破碎
Yeah, it's because I'm kinda broken on the inside.

138
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,345
你觉得这个总数会是多少？

那是第二辆
And that is U-Haul number two.

让我们卸一些U-Haul
Let's unload some U-Hauls.

156
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,622
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

157
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,790
一些牛奶 老兄
Some milk, man.

158
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,325

我知道我们有乔伊能帮忙 但我们还需要更多的后援
And I know we have Joey here to help, but we still needed more backup.

167
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:44,143
所以我带了一个部队

168
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:46,446

明天早上之前我们必须把一切都准备好

180
00:06:11,504 --> 00:06:13,406
克里斯 你负责洗衣机和烘干机
Chris, you're in charge of the washer and dryer.

181
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,641
钱德勒 你想做什么就做什么 因为你是小钱钱
Chandler, you do what you wanna do, because you're Chandler.

182
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,476
额？
Huh?

183
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,310
动身吧 大家！
Let's go, people!

184
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,146
车子剩下的就是这个漂亮的冰箱 我一直在找它
What we have left is this beautiful fridge that I've been looking for my whole life.

185
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,981
这个坏小子 4000瓦
This bad boy, 4, 000 watts.

186
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:25,685
里面有20盏灯 四个柜子和一个按钮

188
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:29,222
你想明天早上我们给他一个惊喜的时候再过来吗？
Do you wanna come back tomorrow morning when we surprise him?

189
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,723
真的？
Really?

190
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,593
如果他们摔了这个割草机 查德就不会高兴了
If they drop this lawnmower, Chad ain't gonna be happy.

191
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,496
冰箱里一定有牛奶
There's gotta be some milk in this fridge.

192
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,663
当然是为了我的奥利奥
For my Oreos of course.

193
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,034
噢 噢
Oww, oww.

194
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,410
牛奶在哪里？
Where's the milk?

195
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:54,547
牛奶在哪里？
Where's the milk?

196
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,050
我的冰箱里就有牛奶
My fridge comes with milk.

197
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,853
钱德勒 如果你不介意的话 他们想把冰箱放在屋里
Chandler, if you don't mind, they're trying to put the fridge in the house.

198
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:01,687
拜托 退后一点
Please, just step back.

199
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,555
好的 继续吧
All right, go on.

200
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:06,692
所以我们低调地给他的店打了电话 他的经理开车来了现场
So we low-key called back his store, and his manager actually drove out to the shoot

201
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,894
他有话要说
and he had this to say.

202
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,328
所以 我们在电话里告诉你这个故事
So, we told you this story on the phone.

203
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:12,865
我们订了披萨 乔伊送过来 现在他只是帮我们搬家具
We ordered a pizza, Joey delivered it, and now he's just helping us move furniture.

204
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,102
所以是的 最后我们会把房子给他
So yeah, at the end of the day we're giving him this house.

205
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,003
哇 呃
Wow, uh.

206
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,640
你能再多说一点吗？
So could you tell a little bit more?

207
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,443
因为老实说他没有告诉我们太多关于他的私生活的事
Because honestly he hasn't told us much about his personal life.

208
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,946
孩子不在的时候 他总是做兼职
When the kid's off he works on side jobs all the time.

209
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,116
他现在住在一个房东不给力的地方
He lives in a place right now where the landlord's not too cool.

210
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,518
乔伊每天要开车一小时上班
Joey has to drive an hour to work every day.

211
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,655
我们要给他的新房子离工作只有15分钟的路程
And this new house we're about to give him is only 15 minutes away from work.

212
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,991
我真的很高兴他需要它 这将真正改变他的生活
I'm just really happy that he needs it, and this will genuinely change his life.

213
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:42,295
智能电视 65英寸 4K 你知道 哈！
Smart TV, 65 inch, 4K, you know, ha!

214
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:46,232
爸爸 爸爸 别伤害我！
Da, da, don't hurt me!

215
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,066
啊 啊！
Ahh, ahh!

216
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:50,536
趴下！
Get on the ground!

217
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,071
刷牙！
Brush his teeth!

218
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,206
我要给你刷牙！
I'm going to brush your teeth!

219
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,775
我要给你刷牙！
I will brush your teeth!

220
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,646
哇 这是什么？
Whoa, what is this?

221
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,481
哦！
Oh!

222
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,488
我没想到会有那么多零部件 恩... 别人的问题了
I didn't expect that to be in that many pieces. Um, somebody else's problem.

223
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,622
马库斯！
Marcus!

224
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,804
我称之为“抽象之桌”
I call it, "Desk a la abstract. "

225
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,805
哦 我的上帝
Oh my god.

226
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,907
是你干的 就是你？
You did that, that's you?

227
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,208
我看了说明书
I read the instructions.

228
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,510

已经14个小时了
It's been 14 long hours.

230
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:42,221
我们买了一栋房子
We've bought a house.

差不多花了10万

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,860
然后我们花了数万美元买了房子的物品
And then we spent tens of thousands of dollars on items for said house.

234
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,096
我一个人在Lowe's就花了将近1万美元
I spent almost 10 grand at Lowe's by myself.

235
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:50,930
谢谢您！
Thank you!

236
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,298

他会穿过那扇门
He's gonna walk through that door,

244
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:10,049
我要告诉他这实际上是他的房子
and I'm gonna inform him that this is in fact his house.

245
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,150
来吧

We spent so much money on this furniture, that we can't even pay you

252
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,597
我们答应给你的那几千美元
the few thousand dollars we promised,

253
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,332
因为我们把所有的钱都投到你的房子里了

264
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,114
我们在查德的事上撒谎了
