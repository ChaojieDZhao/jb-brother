1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,510
我刚买下了这房子 我要把它送给钱德
I just bought this house, and I'm gonna give it to Chandler.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,176
-真的吗？-假的
-Really? - No.

3
00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:08,183
但是 我要把它给一个送披萨的人 这是怎么做的
But, I am gonna give it to a pizza delivery guy, and here's how.

4
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,330
我们点了披萨
We ordered a pizza.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,770
多米诺比萨饼 我能为您效劳吗？
Domino's Pizza, how can I help you?

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,673
我可以要一个意大利香肠吗？请送货
Can I have a pepperoni? Delivery, please.

7
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:16,650
然后我们雇了一个送披萨的人帮我们搬了一整天家具
Then we paid a pizza delivery guy to help us move furniture all day.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,330
我们只需要帮忙搬家具
We just need help moving furniture.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,830
如果我们给你几千美元
If we were to give you a few thousand dollars,

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,350
你能帮我们搬一整天家具吗？
could you just help us move furniture all day?

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,320
当然 -真的吗？
Sure. - Really?

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,210
我们只告诉他我们是年轻人 我们需要一个额外的手动家具
All we told him is that we are YouTubers and we needed an extra hand moving furniture.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,210
因为我们的朋友查德下岗了 我们真的很想帮助他
Because our friend Chad got laid off, and we really wanted to help him.

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,300
但他不知道 查德不是真的
But little does he know, Chad isn't real.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,870
最后我们会
At the end of the day we would actually

16
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,300
把房子的100%所有权给他
give him 100% ownership of the house

17
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,385
他正在帮我们搬家具
he is helping us move furniture into.

18
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,676
恶作剧！-找到他了
Pranked! - Got him.

19
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,220
令人惊讶的是 他也同意
Surprisingly, he's going along with it.

20
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,820
他以为他只得到几千美元
All he thinks he's getting is a few thousand dollars.

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,120
把家具搬进去后 我们会说 “这把钥匙是你的 ”
After we move all the furniture in, we're just gonna be like, "This key is yours. "

22
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,703
好吧 去沃尔玛
All right, to Walmart it is.

23
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,260
我们只是想填满他的房子
We're trying to just fill his house.

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,500
家具也是

我们从卧室开始吧
So let's start in the bedroom.

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,843
很自信
It's assertive.

29
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,170
哦 还有气腰
Oh, and it's got air lumbar.

好悲伤
Good grief.

钱德勒 你觉得这个怎么样？

33
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,810
哇哦 你们都听到了吗？
Whoo-hoo, did you all hear that?

34
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,575
乔伊 你能给我们做个爆震测试吗？

35
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,040
是 啊

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,700
再见 这就是我们带乔伊来的原因
See you guys, this is why we brought Joey.

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,010
实际上我刚给我妈妈买了这台电视

我们有电视 有书摊 还有椅子
We have a TV, we have a bookstand, and we have a chair.

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,750
我们再拿一台电视机
Let's grab another TV.

44
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,323
这个里面有罗库
This one has Roku in it.

45
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,981
我想我们可以走了
I think we're good to go.

46
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,560
他是我们多米诺骨牌的人
He's our Domino's guy.

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,402
我们把他带到任何地方
We just bring him everywhere.

48
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,330
你觉得你今天会这样做吗？
Did you think you would be doing this today?

49
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,177

所以总共是2360美元

52
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
比我想象的要少

53
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,580
所以我们把家具做了
So we got the furniture sort of done.

54
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,730
是 啊 -好吧 我们有个U型运输机

看 这就是我们带你来的原因 乔伊

一整天 只要乔伊告诉我们

他喜欢的东西 我会去另一个通道 我会打电话给杰克告诉他
he liked something, I would go to a different aisle, and I'd call Jake and tell him.

60
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,639
杰克负责秘密买东西 所以当我们让乔伊对房子感到惊讶的时候
Jake was in charge of covertly buying stuff so when we surprised Joey with the house,

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,800
我们可以把这些对他也很重要的酷东西都放在里面
we could have all this other cool stuff that means a lot to him in there as well.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,633
吉米打电话给我
Jimmy's calling me.

63
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,466
嘿 怎么了 伙计？

我要你给他买一部最新的iPhone 一堆狗用的东西
I need you to get him the newest iPhone, a bunch of stuff for dogs,

67
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,100

嘿 伙计们 我们有猫粮

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,483
他有一条狗
He has a dog.

76
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:35,490
哦 -他在想什么？
Oooh. - What was he thinking?

77
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,200
我们怎么才能得到一千个怪物？
How are we gonna get a thousand Monster?

78
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,670
把它装起来！
Load it up!

79
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,586
我们把它们都拿过来

00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,000
给她买很多玩具
Get her lots of toys.

哦 太好了 谢谢

00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,900
尽管你像个大块头和吓人的人 但你是个完美的男人
Despite the fact that you are like ginormous and scary, you'rethe perfect guy for this.

86
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,060
再见 再见

87
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,893
再见

88
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:55,280
我们是给她弄个游乐场 还是给她弄辆真正酷的摩托车？
Do we get her a playhouse, or do we get her one of the really cool motorized cars?

89
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,750
你不能两个都拿错
You can't go wrong with getting both.

90
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,800

92
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,150
盲人驾驶
Driving blind.

93
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,240
我们在二号店 还有一些家具

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,470

潜水感觉如何？-没有疼

00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,547
一切都很顺利 他不知道
This is going so well, he has no idea.

100
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:18,570
记住 现在他正在帮我们挑选他自己家的家具
Remember, right now he's helping us pick out furniture for his own house.

101
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,980
你觉得这整件事怎么样？
So what do you think about this whole thing?

102
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,970
我觉得有点酷
I think it's kinda cool

00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:35,364

他们应该是 我们有很多好东西 兄弟
They should be, we got a lot of good stuff, bro.

115
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,530
你最好别摔倒 孩子
What are you doin' better not fall, boy.

116
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,640
是这样吗？
Is that it?

117
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,690
就这样
That's it.

118
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,700
我们从这里出去吧
Let's get out of here.

119
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,807
我们现在使用手机 因为我们不能在沃尔玛直接购买手机
We're now at US Cellular because we could not buy a phone outright at Walmart.

120
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:54,830
所以我们可以给他一个新电话
So we can surprise him with a new phone.

121
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,700
我们正在做一个视频 我们要用一个全新的iPhone 11给一个家伙一个惊喜
We're doing a video, and we're gonna surprise a guy with a brand new iPhone 11.

122
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,710
这里的一切都很酷
Everything here, it is cool.

123
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,560
太棒了 非常感谢你们
Awesome, thank you all so much.

124
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,130
乔伊正在喝咖啡 他绕了一小段路
So Joey's currently getting coffee, he took a little detour,

125
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,450
所以我们要在没有他的情况下买点东西
so we're gonna shop a little without him.

126
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,860
乔伊回来之前 你们觉得怎么样？
Before Joey gets back here, how do you guys think it's going?

127
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,778
我觉得一切都很顺利
I think it's going good.

128
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:10,660
他不知道 -他不知道
He has no idea. - He has no idea.

129
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,790
不 你觉得他会哭吗？
No, you think he'll cry?

130
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,623
希望如此 -我可能会哭
I hope so. - I might cry.

131
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:13,850
我想他会流泪的
I think he's gonna break out into tears.

132
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,712
所以你说你还没有花足够的钱 对吧？
So you said you hadn't spent enough money yet, right?

133
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:16,676
我们几乎什么都没花
We've spent hardly anything.

134
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,760
好吧 你在这里会掉很多钱的
Well, you're about to drop a lot of money here.

135
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,593
我敢说
I dare you.

136
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,666
我们要一套五月标签
We want the set of the May tags.

137
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,400
我们可以买这个 上面有个平板电脑
We can get this one, it's got a tablet on it.

138
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,340
我花了几十万美元买些蠢货 但即使这样也太过分了
I blow hundreds of thousands of dollars on dumb stuff, but even this seems excessive.

139
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,280
里面有个扬声器
It's got a speaker in it.

140
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,880
不要紧 这就解释了 我们去拿吧
Never mind, that explains it, let's get it.

141
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,010
嘿 钱德勒 克里斯现在要卖了

你是799美元
You're $799.

143
00:04:32,843 --> 00:04:35,350
你本来是1500美元 但现在打折了
You were $1, 500 but you're on discount.

144
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,690
是的 因为我内心有点崩溃
Yeah, it's because I'm kinda broken on the inside.

145
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,410
你觉得这个总数会是多少？
So how much do youthink this total's gonna be?

146

我想是9000美元
I would say $9, 000.

147
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:41,760
我们55岁了
We're at 55 with all that.

148
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,070
我们得弄个烤架和割草机
We gotta get a grill and a lawnmower.

149
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,668
2800美元
2, 800 dollars.

150
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:50,210
好吧 总共9586美元
Okay, your total is $9, 586.

151
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,600
所有的购物都结束了
All the shopping is done.

152
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,797
我们把它装上 然后去房子
Let's load it up and head to the house.

153
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,759
好吧 我们把它带回家给查德
All right, let's take it home for Chad.

154
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,470
你很好 你很好
You're good, you're good.

155
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,303
快回来
Come on back now.

156
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,380
我害怕 我害怕！
I'm scared, I'm scared!

157
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,612
停止了只是--
That stopped just--

158
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:12,883
那就是你的号码
Well that is U-Haul number one.

159
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,713
天啊
Oh god.

160
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,290
那是第二个长途电话
And that is U-Haul number two.

161
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,390
现在我们得把房子填满 这样明天就能给查德一个惊喜
Now we need to fill the house up so we can surprise Chad tomorrow.

162
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,710
让我们卸一些U形拖车
Let's unload some U-Hauls.

163
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,670
你在找什么？
What are you looking for?

164
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,837
喝点牛奶 伙计
Some milk, man.

165
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,385
为什么牛奶会在橱柜里？
Why would milk be in the cabinet?

166
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:26,218
没有冰箱
There's no fridge.

167
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:27,051
我们得把它放进去
We gotta put it in.

168
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:27,930
哦
Oh.

169

如果你想要牛奶就去拿冰箱 -好吧

00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:35,150
哥们 查德的新台面上到处都是面包屑 伙计
Dude, you got crumbs all over Chad's new counter tops, man.

171
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,117
幸好我们买了纸巾和克罗克斯湿巾！
Good thing we bought paper towels and Clorox wipes!

172
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,850
这是很多东西
This is a lot of stuff.

173
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,520
我知道我们有乔伊要帮忙
And I know we have Joey here to help,

174
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,090
但我们还需要更多的后援
but we still needed more backup.

175
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,200
所以我带来了一支军队
So I brought an army.

176
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,490
伙计们 集合！
Come on in guys, assemble!

177
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,640
我们把房子盖起来吧

所以明天我们可以给查德一个惊喜

盒子破了！

杰克 杰克 杰克 杰克 杰克 杰克 杰克！
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

182
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,280
我要去哪里？
Where am I going?

183
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,580
拉 拉 拉 拉 拉 拉
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

184
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,768
推 推 推 推 推 推
Push, push, push, push, push, push.

185
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:03,950
休息 休息 休息 休息 休息 休息
Rest, rest, rest, rest, rest, rest.

186
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,210
我们明天上午九点带查德来
We're bringing Chad here tomorrow at nine AM.

187
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,450
所以我们要给他一个惊喜
So we're gonna surprise him then.

188
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,570
明天早上之前我们必须把一切都准备好
We have to have everything ready by tomorrow morning.

189
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,440
克里斯 你负责洗衣机和烘干机
Chris, you're in charge of the washer and dryer.

190
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,707
钱德勒 你想做什么就做什么 因为你是钱德勒
Chandler, you do what you wanna do, because you're Chandler.

191
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:16,540
嗯？
Huh?

192
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,373
我们走吧 大家！
Let's go, people!

193
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,200
我们剩下的就是这个漂亮的冰箱 我一直在寻找我的一生
What we have left is this beautiful fridge that I've been looking for my whole life.

194
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,030
这个坏小子 4 000瓦
This bad boy, 4, 000 watts.

195
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,730
里面有20盏灯 4个柜子和一个按钮
It's got 20 lights in it, four cabinets, and a button.

196
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,563
我们把它取下来！
Let's get it off!

197
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:29,288
你想明天早上我们给他一个惊喜的时候再来吗？
Do you wanna come back tomorrow morning when we surprise him?

198
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,779
真的？
Really?

199
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,633
如果他们放下割草机 查德就不会高兴了
If they drop this lawnmower, Chad ain't gonna be happy.

200
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,550
冰箱里一定有牛奶
There's gotta be some milk in this fridge.

201
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,700
当然是为了我的奥利奥
For my Oreos of course.

202
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,078
噢 噢
Oww, oww.

203
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,430
牛奶在哪里？
Where's the milk?

204
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,593
牛奶在哪里？
Where's the milk?

205
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,090
我的冰箱里有牛奶
My fridge comes with milk.

206
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,910
钱德 如果你不介意的话 他们想把冰箱放在屋里
Chandler, if you don't mind, they're trying to put the fridge in the house.

207
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,743
拜托 退后一点
Please, just step back.

208
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:02,600
好吧 继续
All right, go on.

209
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,730
所以我们低调地回了他的店 他的经理开车去拍摄
So we low-key called back his store, and his manager actually drove out to the shoot

210
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,960
他有话要说
and he had this to say.

211
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,380
所以 我们在电话里告诉你这个故事
So, we told you this story on the phone.

212
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,930
我们点了比萨饼 乔伊送过来了 现在他只是帮我们搬家具
We ordered a pizza, Joey delivered it, and now he's just helping us move furniture.

213
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,150
所以是的 最后我们会把房子给他
So yeah, at the end of the day we're giving him this house.

214
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,047
哇 呃
Wow, uh.

215
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,683
你能再多说一点吗？
So could you tell a little bit more?

216
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,480
因为老实说他没有告诉我们太多关于他的私生活的事
Because honestly he hasn't told us much about his personal life.

217
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,010
孩子不在的时候 他总是做兼职
When the kid's off he works on side jobs all the time.

218
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,170
他现在住在一个房东不太冷静的地方
He lives in a place right now where the landlord's not too cool.

219
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,570
乔伊每天要开车一小时上班
Joey has to drive an hour to work every day.

220
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,720
我们要给他的新房子离工作只有15分钟的路程
And this new house we're about to give him is only 15 minutes away from work.

221
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,030
我真的很高兴他需要它 这将真正改变他的生活
I'm just really happy that he needs it, and this will genuinely change his life.

222
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,357
智能电视 65英寸 4K 你知道 哈！
Smart TV, 65 inch, 4K, you know, ha!

223
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,281
爸 爸 别伤害我！
Da, da, don't hurt me!

224
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,114
啊 啊！
Ahh, ahh!

225
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,575
趴下！
Get on the ground!

226
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,124
刷牙！
Brush his teeth!

227
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,270
我要给你刷牙！
I'm going to brush your teeth!

228
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,818
我要给你刷牙！
I will brush your teeth!

229
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,690
哇 这是什么？
Whoa, what is this?

230
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,523
哦！
Oh!

231
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,498
我没想到会有那么多碎片 嗯 别人的问题
I didn't expect that to be in that many pieces. Um, somebody else's problem.

232
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:09,687
马库斯！
Marcus!

233
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,840
我称之为“书桌抽象”
I call it, "Desk a la abstract. "

234
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
哦 我的上帝
Oh my god.

235
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,950
是你干的 就是你？
You did that, that's you?

236
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,250
我看了说明书
I read the instructions.

237
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,537
他们是越南语的
They were in Vietnamese.

238
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,090
已经14个小时了
It's been 14 long hours.

239
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,278
我们买了一栋房子
We've bought a house.

240
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:43,111
我们做到了
We did.

241
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:43,943
差不多花了10万
Which cost almost 100 grand.

242
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:47,900
然后我们花了数万美元买了房子的东西
And then we spent tens of thousands of dollars on items for said house.

243
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,140
我一个人在洛伊家花了将近1万美元
I spent almost 10 grand at Lowe's by myself.

244
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,973
谢谢您！
Thank you!

245
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:52,360
看 我们没花多少钱
See, we weren't spending much.

246
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,725
我为你感到骄傲 你得到了加薪
I'm proud of you, you get a raise.

247

谢谢您
Thank you.

248
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,760
乔伊整天都跟着我们
Joey's been following us around all day.

249
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,090
不知道 这房子是他的
No idea, that this house is his.

250
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,980
我们买了这所房子 他将永远保留它

是他的

252
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,410
他会穿过那扇门
He's gonna walk through that door,

253
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,110
我要告诉他这实际上是他的房子
and I'm gonna inform him that this is in fact his house.

254
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,210
我们来吧
Let's do it.

255
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,206
抱歉 面试怎么样？
Sorry about that interview, how'd it go?

256
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,140
没关系
It was all right.

257
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,973
是不是很尴尬？
Was it awkward?

258
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:16,864
对
Yes.

259
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,500
如你所知 有些事发生了
As you can tell, something's up.

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,400
我们在这件家具上花了那么多钱 连你的钱都付不起
We spent so much money on this furniture, that we can't even pay you

261
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,660
我们答应的几千美元
the few thousand dollars we promised,

262
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,370
因为我们把所有的钱都放在你家里了

这是给你的
This is for you.

274
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,160
我们在乍得的事上撒谎
We were lying about Chad.

275
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,430
整个房子都是给你的
This whole house is for you.

276
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,336
乍得根本不存在 -等等 真的吗？

277
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,330
太棒了！

00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,580
所以我们早些时候注意到你手机上有一个怪物贴纸
So we noticed earlier that you had a Monster sticker on your phone.

282

然后你说你养了一条狗
And then you said you had a dog,

285
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,930
所以我们给你买了一堆狗粮

286
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,320
还有一些玩具给他
And some toys for him.

287
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,850
我们不知道是哪个牌子的 所以我们就买了
We didn't know which brand, so we just got all of 'em.

288
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,683
真 的！
Wow!

289
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:07,640

294
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:13,810
