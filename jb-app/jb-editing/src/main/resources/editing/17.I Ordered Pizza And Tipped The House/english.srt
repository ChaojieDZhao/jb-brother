1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,510
- I just bought this house, and I'm gonna give it to Chandler.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,176
- Really? - No.

3
00:00:05,176 --> 00:00:08,183
But, I am gonna give it to a pizza delivery guy, and here's how.

4
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:09,330
We ordered a pizza.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,770
- [Woman] Domino's Pizza, how can I help you?

6
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,673
- Can I have a pepperoni? Delivery, please.

7
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:16,650
Then we paid a pizza delivery guy to help us move furniture all day.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,330
We just need help moving furniture.

9
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,830
If we were to give you a few thousand dollars,

10
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,350
could you just help us move furniture all day?

11
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,320
- Sure. - Really?

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,210
All we told him is that we are YouTubers and we needed an extra hand moving furniture.

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,210
Because our friend Chad got laid off, and we really wanted to help him.

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,300
But little does he know, Chad isn't real.

15
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,870
At the end of the day we would actually

16
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:35,300
give him 100% ownership of the house

17
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,385
he is helping us move furniture into.

18
00:00:37,385 --> 00:00:39,676
- Pranked! - Got him.

19
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:40,509
(electrical zapping)

20
00:00:40,509 --> 00:00:42,220
- Surprisingly, he's going along with it.

21
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,820
All he thinks he's getting is a few thousand dollars.

22
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,120
After we move all the furniture in, we're just gonna be like, "This key is yours. "

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,703
All right, to Walmart it is.

24
00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:53,810
(R&B music)

25
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,260
We're trying to just fill his house.

26
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,500
So furniture.

27
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,620
- So let's start in the bedroom.

28
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,813
- [Voiceover] Oh, baby.

29
00:00:58,813 --> 00:01:00,010
- What do you think of a chair like this?

30
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:00,843
- It's assertive.

31
00:01:00,843 --> 00:01:02,170
Oh, and it's got air lumbar.

32
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,133
Chad's lumbar do be needin' air.

33
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:06,948
- Good grief.

34
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:08,886
- Chandler, what do you think of this?

35
00:01:08,886 --> 00:01:09,719
(knuckles rapping)

36
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,810
- Whoo-hoo, did you all hear that?

37
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:12,575
- Joey, can you give us the knock test?

38
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,530
(knuckles rapping)

39
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,040
- Yeah.

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,700
- See you guys, this is why we brought Joey.

41
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,640
He's incredibly helpful.

42
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,010
- I actually just bought my mom this TV.

43
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,843
- What do you think of it, Joey?

44
00:01:20,843 --> 00:01:22,190
- It's a nice TV.

45
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,023
- Let's do it.

46
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,560
- We have a TV, we have a bookstand, and we have a chair.

47
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,750
Let's grab another TV.

48
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,323
This one has Roku in it.

49
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,981
I think we're good to go.

50
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,560
- He's our Domino's guy.

51
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,402
We just bring him everywhere.

52
00:01:37,402 --> 00:01:38,977
(register beeping)

53
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:40,330
- [Tareq] Did you think you would be doing this today?

54
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,177
- No, I didn't.

55
00:01:41,177 --> 00:01:42,150
- At all?- No.

56
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,440
- So the total is 2, 360 dollars.

57
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,280
Way less than I thought.

58
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,580
- So we got the furniture sort of done.

59
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,730
- Yeah. - All right, we got a U-Haul

60
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,955
for this stuff for Chad's house.

61
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:50,922
(cart wheels grinding on the ramp)

62
00:01:50,922 --> 00:01:53,750
- Whoosh. - Ahh!

63
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:56,333
(door banging)

64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,130
- See, this is why we brought you, Joey.

65
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,010
Throughout the day, anytime Joey told us

66
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,840
he liked something, I would go to a different aisle, and I'd call Jake and tell him.

67
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,639
Jake was in charge of covertly buying stuff so when we surprised Joey with the house,

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,800
we could have all this other cool stuff that means a lot to him in there as well.

69
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,633
- Jimmy's calling me.

70
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,466
Hey, what's up, buddy?

71
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,840
- Hey, so I rode with him in the car and I got some intel.

72
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,673
- Okay, what you got?

73
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:19,560
- I need you to get him the newest iPhone, a bunch of stuff for dogs,

74
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,100
and then he had a Monster sticker on his phone, so get him like a thousand.

75
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,933
Get him a thousand.

76
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:25,187
- A thousand? All right, you ready, Marcus?

77
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,120
We got it. - We got it.

78
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,953
- Let's do it.

79
00:02:26,953 --> 00:02:28,600
- We got the Gravy bone.

80
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,030
- Hey guys, we got the cat food.

81
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,930
He said he needed cat food, right?

82
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,483
- He has a dog.

83
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:35,490
- Oooh. - What was he thinking?

84
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,200
- How are we gonna get a thousand Monster?

85
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,670
- [Marcus] Load it up!

86
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,586
- [Jake] Let's get all of 'em.

87
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:42,170
- [Jimmy] Very important intel, are you ready?

88
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,180
- Yes, we're ready.

89
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,050
- [Jimmy] He has a three year old daughter.

90
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,000
Get her lots of toys.

91
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,449
- Oh, perfect, thank you.

92
00:02:46,449 --> 00:02:49,900
- [Jimmy] Despite the fact that you are like ginormous and scary, you'rethe perfect guy for this.

93
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,060
I'll be seeing you, bye.

94
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,893
- Bye.

95
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:55,280
Do we get her a playhouse, or do we get her one of the really cool motorized cars?

96
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,750
- You can't go wrong with getting both.

97
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,800
- Well, let's do both then!

98
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,580
- [Marcus] I think he'sgoing a little overboard.

99
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,150
- Driving blind.

100
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,240
- We're at store number two, some more furniture.

101
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,470
- Chris, this looks good.

102
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,595
- Leather?- Oooh, I like this.

103
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:07,600
(dolphin chattering)

104
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,266
- [Jimmy] How'd that dive feel? - [Chandler] It didn't hurt.

105
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,550
- I want both these.

106
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,370
- Oh yeah, this one's a lot better.

107
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,547
- This is going so well, he has no idea.

108
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:18,570
- Remember, right now he's helping us pick out furniture for his own house.

109
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:19,980
So what do you think about this whole thing?

110
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,970
- I think it's kinda cool

111
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,480
that you all are helping this man.

112
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,680
- So next up, obviously, we need a bed for Chad.

113
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,340
- Ohh!- All right, I want it.

114
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,960
(register beeping)

115
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,270
So far we're at $2, 400.

116
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,320
I wanna spend more money.

117
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,284
And that is store number two down.

118
00:03:34,284 --> 00:03:35,364
Whoosh.

119
00:03:35,364 --> 00:03:37,720
(R&B music)

120
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,553
- [Jake] $1, 400.

121
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:41,080
- [Marcus] Boy, that's a wrap. - And we still have four carts.

122
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,540
- Look at this receipt!

123
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,450
I hope they're happy.

124
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,030
They should be, we got a lot of good stuff, bro.

125
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,530
What are you doin' better not fall, boy.

126
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,640
- [Jake] Is that it?

127
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,690
- That's it.

128
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,700
Let's get out of here.

129
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,807
- We're now at US Cellular because we could not buy a phone outright at Walmart.

130
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:54,830
So we can surprise him with a new phone.

131
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,700
We're doing a video, and we're gonna surprise a guy with a brand new iPhone 11.

132
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,710
Everything here, it is cool.

133
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,560
Awesome, thank you all so much.

134
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,130
- So Joey's currently getting coffee, he took a little detour,

135
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:05,450
so we're gonna shop a little without him.

136
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:07,860
Before Joey gets back here, how do you guys think it's going?

137
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,778
- I think it's going good.

138
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:10,660
- He has no idea. - He has no idea.

139
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,790
- No, you think he'll cry?

140
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:12,623
- I hope so. - I might cry.

141
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:13,850
- I think he's gonna break out into tears.

142
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,712
- So you said you hadn't spent enough money yet, right?

143
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:16,676
- We've spent hardly anything.

144
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,760
- Well, you're about to drop a lot of money here.

145
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,593
- I dare you.

146
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,666
- We want the set of the May tags.

147
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,400
We can get this one, it's got a tablet on it.

148
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,340
- I blow hundreds of thousands of dollars on dumb stuff, but even this seems excessive.

149
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,280
- It's got a speaker in it.

150
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,880
- Never mind, that explains it, let's get it.

151
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,010
Hey Chandler, Chris is now for sale.

152
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,843
You're $799.

153
00:04:32,843 --> 00:04:35,350
You were $1, 500 but you're on discount.

154
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,690
- [Chris] Yeah, it's because I'm kinda broken on the inside.

155
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,410
- [Tareq] So how much do youthink this total's gonna be?

156
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,243
- I would say $9, 000.

157
00:04:40,243 --> 00:04:41,760
- We're at 55 with all that.

158
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,070
We gotta get a grill and a lawnmower.

159
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,668
2, 800 dollars.

160
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,007
(register beeping)

161
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:50,210
- Okay, your total is $9, 586.

162
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,600
- All the shopping is done.

163
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,797
Let's load it up and head to the house.

164
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:55,040
(dolly wheels bumping)

165
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,972
(R&B music)

166
00:04:57,972 --> 00:04:59,671
(door banging)

167
00:04:59,671 --> 00:05:01,759
All right, let's take it home for Chad.

168
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,710
(clock ticking)

169
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,470
- You're good, you're good.

170
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,303
Come on back now.

171
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,380
I'm scared, I'm scared!

172
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,612
That stopped just--

173
00:05:09,612 --> 00:05:10,857
(glass breaking)

174
00:05:10,857 --> 00:05:12,883
- Well that is U-Haul number one.

175
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,713
Oh god.

176
00:05:15,713 --> 00:05:17,290
And that is U-Haul number two.

177
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,390
Now we need to fill the house up so we can surprise Chad tomorrow.

178
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,710
- Let's unload some U-Hauls.

179
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,670
- [Chris] What are you looking for?

180
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,837
- Some milk, man.

181
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:25,385
- [Chris] Why would milk be in the cabinet?

182
00:05:25,385 --> 00:05:26,218
- There's no fridge.

183
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:27,051
We gotta put it in.

184
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:27,930
(dial-up modem beeping)- Oh.

185
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,086
- Go grab the fridge if you want milk. - Okay.

186
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,412
(cabinet door slamming)

187
00:05:31,412 --> 00:05:35,150
- Dude, you got crumbs all over Chad's new counter tops, man.

188
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,117
- Good thing we bought paper towels and Clorox wipes!

189
00:05:38,117 --> 00:05:38,950
(cookie crunching)

190
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,850
- This is a lot of stuff.

191
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,520
And I know we have Joey here to help,

192
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,090
but we still needed more backup.

193
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,200
So I brought an army.

194
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,490
Come on in guys, assemble!

195
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,640
Let's set up this house

196
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,708
so tomorrow we can surprise Chad.

197
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:50,600
(group yelling and screaming)

198
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,802
- [Group] Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

199
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,166
- [Jake] The box is breaking!

200
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,321
- [Group] Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

201
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,280
- [Jake] Where am I going?

202
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,580
- [Group] Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

203
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,768
- [Group] Push, push, push, push, push, push.

204
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:03,950
- [Group] Rest, rest, rest, rest, rest, rest.

205
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,050
(box sliding)

206
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,210
- We're bringing Chad here tomorrow at nine AM.

207
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,450
So we're gonna surprise him then.

208
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,570
We have to have everything ready by tomorrow morning.

209
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,440
Chris, you're in charge of the washer and dryer.

210
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,707
Chandler, you do what you wanna do, because you're Chandler.

211
00:06:15,707 --> 00:06:16,540
- Huh?

212
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,373
- Let's go, people!

213
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:20,200
- What we have left is this beautiful fridge that I've been looking for my whole life.

214
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,030
This bad boy, 4, 000 watts.

215
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,730
It's got 20 lights in it, four cabinets, and a button.

216
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,563
Let's get it off!

217
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:29,288
- Do you wanna come back tomorrow morning when we surprise him?

218
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,779
- Really?

219
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,633
- If they drop this lawnmower, Chad ain't gonna be happy.

220
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,550
- There's gotta be some milk in this fridge.

221
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,700
For my Oreos of course.

222
00:06:40,347 --> 00:06:42,078
- Oww, oww.

223
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:45,911
(plastic utensils clattering)

224
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,430
- Where's the milk?

225
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,593
Where's the milk?

226
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,090
My fridge comes with milk.

227
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,910
- Chandler, if you don't mind, they're trying to put the fridge in the house.

228
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,743
Please, just step back.

229
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:02,600
All right, go on.

230
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,730
So we low-key called back his store, and his manager actually drove out to the shoot

231
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,960
and he had this to say.

232
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,380
- So, we told you this story on the phone.

233
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,930
We ordered a pizza, Joey delivered it, and now he's just helping us move furniture.

234
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:16,150
So yeah, at the end of the day we're giving him this house.

235
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:17,047
- Wow, uh.

236
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:20,683
- So could you tell a little bit more?

237
00:07:20,683 --> 00:07:23,480
Because honestly he hasn't told us much about his personal life.

238
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,010
- When the kid's off he works on side jobs all the time.

239
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:30,170
He lives in a place right now where the landlord's not too cool.

240
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:32,570
- Joey has to drive an hour to work every day.

241
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,720
And this new house we're about to give him is only 15 minutes away from work.

242
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,030
I'm just really happy that he needs it, and this will genuinely change his life.

243
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:42,357
- Smart TV, 65 inch, 4K, you know, ha!

244
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,281
- Da, da, don't hurt me!

245
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,114
Ahh, ahh!

246
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:50,575
- Get on the ground!

247
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,124
- Brush his teeth!

248
00:07:52,124 --> 00:07:53,270
- I'm going to brush your teeth!

249
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,818
I will brush your teeth!

250
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:58,485
(low key music)

251
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:00,690
- Whoa, what is this?

252
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,523
Oh!

253
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:08,498
I didn't expect that to be in that many pieces. Um, somebody else's problem.

254
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:09,687
Marcus!

255
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,952
(low key music)

256
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:17,119
(construction banging and sawing)

257
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,840
- I call it, "Desk a la abstract. "

258
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
- [Jimmy] Oh my god.

259
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,950
You did that, that's you?

260
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,250
- I read the instructions.

261
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,537
They were in Vietnamese.

262
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:33,204
(hip hop music)

263
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,090
- It's been 14 long hours.

264
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,278
We've bought a house.

265
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:43,111
- We did.

266
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:43,943
- Which cost almost 100 grand.

267
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:47,900
And then we spent tens of thousands of dollars on items for said house.

268
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,140
- I spent almost 10 grand at Lowe's by myself.

269
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,973
- Thank you!

270
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:52,360
See, we weren't spending much.

271
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,725
I'm proud of you, you get a raise.

272
00:08:53,725 --> 00:08:54,558
- Thank you.

273
00:08:54,558 --> 00:08:56,760
- Joey's been following us around all day.

274
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,090
No idea, that this house is his.

275
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,980
We bought this house and he is going to keep it, forever.

276
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,930
It is his.

277
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:06,410
He's gonna walk through that door,

278
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,110
and I'm gonna inform him that this is in fact his house.

279
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,210
Let's do it.

280
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,206
Sorry about that interview, how'd it go?

281
00:09:13,206 --> 00:09:15,140
- It was all right.

282
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:15,973
- [Jimmy] Was it awkward?

283
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:16,864
- Yes.

284
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:17,697
(group laughing)

285
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,500
- As you can tell, something's up.

286
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,400
We spent so much money on this furniture, that we can't even pay you

287
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,660
the few thousand dollars we promised,

288
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,370
because we put all the money into your house.

289
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,230
So yeah, sorry about that.

290
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,063
- Okay.

291
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,100
- Yeah, your house looks nice.

292
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,910
- Yeah, what do you think of his house, Jake?

293
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,743
- I think it's awesome,

294
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,075
I think he's really gonna enjoy it.

295
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:36,908
- What?

296
00:09:36,908 --> 00:09:37,741
- [Jake] This is your house.

297
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,587
- Yeah, your house.

298
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:39,420
- Oh, we didn't tell you?

299
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,450
This is for you.

300
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,160
We were lying about Chad.

301
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,430
This whole house is for you.

302
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,336
Chad doesn't exist. - Wait, serious?

303
00:09:45,336 --> 00:09:46,330
That is awesome!

304
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,700
- [Jake] You are Chad.

305
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,533
- Thank you!

306
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,720
- [Marcus] Yeah son, this is your house.

307
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,580
- So we noticed earlier that you had a Monster sticker on your phone.

308
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,620
So we bought you 100 cans of Monster.

309
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:57,453
- Wow.

310
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:59,510
- And then you said you had a dog,

311
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,930
so we bought you a bunch of dog food.

312
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,320
And some toys for him.

313
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,850
We didn't know which brand, so we just got all of 'em.

314
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,683
- Wow!

315
00:10:05,683 --> 00:10:07,640
- [Chandler] We reminded you of your favorite thing.

316
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,473
- [Chris] Pizza.

317
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:09,306
- [Chandler] Pizza.

318
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:11,440
- Oh wow, there's more pizza in the stove.

319
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,273
Didn't even know that was there.

320
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:13,810
- Did you have any idea all day?

321
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:14,643
- No, I did not.

322
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:15,930
- No, you really didn't?

323
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,740
We were getting kinda worried because Jimmy let it slip a couple of times.

324
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,800
He's like oh yeah.

325
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,050
- I really didn't, at all.

326
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,360
It is awesome.

327
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,060
- Oh yeah, we got a couple of extra things too we should show him.

328
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,520
We bought some toys because you mentioned you have a daughter.

329
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,370
So we got her some toys too.

330
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,203
- [Joey] Wow.

331
00:10:31,203 --> 00:10:32,760
- I know this must be I don't know her,

332
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,170
so I know, it's a lot.

333
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,360
- It really is, it's awesome, you all.

334
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,193
- It's all yours.

335
00:10:37,193 --> 00:10:39,770
Like this owl, it's yours.

336
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,705
Do what you want with it.

337
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,538
You can just throw it.

338
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:42,371
- Just throw it?

339
00:10:42,371 --> 00:10:43,568
(group cheering affirmatively)

340
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:44,920
Oh my god, this is awesome.

341
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,350
- All right, there's still more rooms.

342
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,130
We don't know too much about decorating, but we assumed this would be your room.

343
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,853
So you said you liked hunting, so we got you hunting things.

344
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,983
- Oh really?

345
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,640
- And here is the final room.

346
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,870
I know, just a bed.

347
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,750
You mentioned you have a PlayStation, so got some PlayStation stuff, and a Switch.

348
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:08,043
- Oh my god, you all are amazing.

349
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,190
- So we were talking to your manager out there

350
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,289
and he said that you are like an hour drive away from work?

351
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,122
- [Joey] Yes.

352
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:19,130
- So this will put you in only like 15 minutes.

353
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,394
- [Chris] Oh, that's great to hear.

354
00:11:20,394 --> 00:11:21,227
- Oh yeah.

355
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,670
- [Jimmy] Do you wanna just say anything to the camera?

356
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:24,270
- These people, they're amazing.

357
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,840
Like my body is shaking a little bit.

358
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,890
- [Group] Oh my gosh!

359
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,323
- Yeah, it's bad.

360
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:33,710
- We literally tricked you into decorating your home.

361
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,190
- [Chris] Get pranked!

362
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,870
Would you have done anything differently?

363
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,960
- No, I like it.

364
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,260
I would never ask for anything like this.

365
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,380
The house we were in,

366
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,690
it was a horrible house.

367
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,520
It was very unsafe, and this house is honestly gonna be a lot better.

368
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,140
Safer for my kids, and better for our living.

369
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,320
We tried to get a house the day before you all gave us this house.

370
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,510
Honestly, I was going into this

371
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,630
thinking I was just getting a couple thousand dollars

372
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,050
to help move furniture.

373
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,440
Someone just really just gave me a house.

374
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,220
Now we can stop worrying about where we're gonna go from here.

375
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:12,100
This is really just a great opportunity for me and my family.

376
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,990
And I just want to thank you Mr. Beast for honestly answering all our prayers.

377
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,187
Because this is something amazing for me.

378
00:12:20,187 --> 00:12:24,020
(group cheering and clapping)

379
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,853
- This is your brand new house.

380
00:12:26,853 --> 00:12:28,670
Here is the key.

381
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,910
I actually lied, I did have the key.

382
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,380
It is yours, seriously.

383
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,700
No strings, no catch, no nothing.

384
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,533
- That's is awesome.

385
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:36,366
You mind if I give you a hug?

386
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:37,244
- Yeah, of course, man!

387
00:12:37,244 --> 00:12:39,498
(group applauding and cheering)

388
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:40,430
And there you have it.

389
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,370
I bought a house, ordered pizza, and gave him said house.

390
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,910
Don't forget to follow meon Instagram and buy merch.

391
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,920
If you want to be entered in to compete in the million dollar series.

392
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,817
Goodbye.
