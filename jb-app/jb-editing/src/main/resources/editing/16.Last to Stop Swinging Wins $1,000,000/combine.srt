45
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,020
既然他在推你 是不是轻松了？
Now that he's pushing you, is it easier?

46
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,854
轻松多了

47
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:31,157
我要确保我说的很清楚 你们不能碰选手
I wanna make sure I'm very clear, you guys cannot touch the contestants

48
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,859
否则红灯将被迫亮起

54
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,367
他碰到你了吗？
Did he get you?

55
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,202

56

特洛伊碰了碰克里斯

58
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,673
让我来告诉你们 如果一个参赛者碰到你们中的一个会发生什么
Let me show you what happens if a contestant touches one of you.

59
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,142
天哪 天哪！
Oh my--- Oh my God!

60
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:50,043
不可能！
There is no way!

61
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:51,177
看到尼克多痛苦了吗？
See how Nick is suffering?

62
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:53,046
这就是为什么你们不应该碰他们
This is why you guys shouldn't touch them.

63
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,983
我不知道你在哪里 他们是否摇摆着用趾甲碰到了你
I don't know if you're out there, if they swing and just touch you with their toenail.

64
00:01:56,983 --> 00:01:57,817
就像那样？
Like that?

65
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,486
-你被碰了？ -对！
-But did you? -Yes!

66
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,587
杰克被碰了！
Jake just got touched!

67
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,188
嘿 我不会把你的移得太远
Hey, I won't move yours as far.

68
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:04,524
我们就把他放在这里
We'll put his right here.

69
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:08,128
我想是时候让他的线回去了 好了 现在他恢复正常了
And I think it's time to move his back. There we go, now he's back to normal.

70
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,263
特洛伊 我们让你觉得被针对了 所以--
Troy, we don't wanna just pick on you, so--

71
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:11,931
◎哦 我的天◎

我一天之内就能赢
I'm gonna win in a day.

78
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:29,015
你必须穿过它们而不被触碰
You have to run through them without getting touched.

79
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,284
我们要用烟雾让他们看不见
We're gonna use the smoke to make it harder for them to see.

80
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,418
准备 准备 走你！
Hut, hut, hike, go!

81
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,157

83
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:41,561
-杰克 -你被碰到了！

84
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,996
准备 准备 走起！
Hut, hut, hike!

85
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,165
再给他点！
Give him more!

86
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:45,999
给他--
Give him--

87
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,833
他抓住他了！
He got him!

88
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,835
钱德勒 你准备好了吗？
Chandler, are you ready?

89
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,702
嘿 不！
Hey, no!

90
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,837
走起！
Hike!

91
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,105

他要自残
He hurt to himself.

95
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,415
所以 惩罚就是你必须在选手下面躺5分钟
So, the punishment is you have to lay under your contestant for five minutes.

96
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,251
我觉得我的叮咚随时都会被踢
I feel like my ding dong's gonna get kicked any second.

97
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,386
事实上 这还挺不错的
Oh, this kinda nice, actually.

98
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,188
你知道吗？ 我是个很好的激励者
You know what? I'm a great motivator.

99
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,758
现在你们都趴在地上了 这就完美地进入了我们的下一个环节
So now that you guys are all laying on the ground, this leads perfectly into our next segment.

105
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:29,042
-马库斯 呆在他下面 -这不公平
-Marcus, just stay under him. -It's not fair.

106
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,377
他为了钱德勒把薯条推得更近了 但不给我！
He pushed it up closer for Chandler, but not for me!

107
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,213
你应该好好尝试 你尽力了吗？

你获得了$5千美元

我觉得我的腿变形了

164
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,757
我们护送他吧
Let's escort him.

165
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:25,792
哦 嘿 钱德勒
Oh, hey Chandler.

166
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,626
你打盹醒来了吗？
Did you wake up from your nap?

167
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,862
-给你 这可以减轻你的痛苦 $5千美元 -酷
-Here you go, this should ease your pain, $5, 000. -Cool.

168
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:32,465
你没有赢$100万美元 但你有$5千
You didn't win a million dollars, but you got five grand.

169
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,566
他们感觉如何？
How do they feel?

170
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,335
-哥们 真的很伤 -是吗？
-Dude, they hurt so bad. -Do they?

171
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,338
你坐在上面的方式 就好像 就在这里钻孔一样
The way you sit on it, it's like, it's like digging into right here.

172
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:41,274
-我想我这里有个瘀伤 -天啊
-Think I have a bruise right here, actually. -Geez.

173
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:43,609
佩顿 你听起来已经到边缘了 所以--
Payton, you already sound like you're on the edge, so--

174
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:47,347
那不是我要找的生意 我只要把口香糖粘起来就行了
That wasn't the business deal I was looking for, I'd just stick up the gum.

175
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,948
所以我们已经知道 佩顿正在苦苦挣扎
So we already know, Payton's struggling.

176
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,917
托尼 真的是你反对奥马尔
Tony, it's really you against Omar.

177
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:54,354
你会是那个站在他面前赢得一百万美元的人吗？
Are you gonna be the one that stands up to him and wins a million dollars?

178
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,154
对
Yes.

179
00:05:55,154 --> 00:05:59,692
因为如果奥马尔赢了 那就意味着杰克的参赛者会赢得第一个和第二个挑战
'Cause if Omar wins, that means Jake's contestant would've won the first challenge and the second.

180
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,594
我觉得我真的没有什么痛苦
I feel like I don't really have much pain.

181
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,297
如果你赢了一百万美元 你会用它买什么？
If you win the million dollars, what would you buy with it?

182
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,899
首先 我要回报我的家人 我的父母
Firstly, I'd give back to my whole family, my parents.

183
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,267
我会继续花$20万美元
$200K I'm gonna keep to spend.

184
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:10,203
-哦 只有20万？-只有20万
-Oh, only 200 grand? -Only 200.

185
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,572
现在我们要给所有参赛者的父母打电话
Now we're gonna call all the contestants' parents.

186
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,073
我们从佩顿的父亲开始
We're gonna start off with Payton's father.

187
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,142
对不起 你要找的人--
I'm sorry, the person you are try--

188
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,746
现在我们要打电话给特洛伊的妈妈

189
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,280
嘿 你是特洛伊的妈妈吗？

190
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,215
对
Yes.

191
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,250
他在秋千上荡了10个小时
He's been swinging on a swing for 10 hours,

192
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,120
如果他赢了 他就可以竞争一百万美元
and if he wins, he gets to compete for a million dollars.

193
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,187
等等 布

194
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,089
别想了 继续摇摆
Just don't think about it, just keep swinging.

195
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:30,923
哦

00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:31,758
随波逐流
Just go with the flow.

197
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,558
爸爸怎么样？
How's dad doin'?

198
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,459
他有好转吗？
Is he getting any better?

199
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:39,198
是的 他们点击了他的心脏去重启 然后他感觉恢复了正常
Yes, they shocked his heart to restart it, and then that makes him feel back to normal.

200
00:06:39,198 --> 00:06:41,501
所以 我要去告诉他发生了什么
So, I'm gonna go and tell him what's going on.

201
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:45,805
集中精神 然后不要想 哦 我累了 还是怎么了
Just concentrate and then don't think about, like, oh, I'm tired, or something.

202
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,639
别想了
Just don't think about it.

203
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,473
不
No.

204
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,008

Just hang in there, baby.

205
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:50,410
哦 现在我要你赢
Oh, now I want you to win.

206
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,111
-奥马尔 出去！ -不！
-Omar, get out! -No!

207
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:52,945
可以

208
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,281
我们会和下一个参赛者通电话 我们会告诉你他是怎么做到的

00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,857
好吧 哇
All right, wow.

216
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,559
奥马尔正要给他妹妹打电话
Omar's about to call his sister.

217
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,493
我们只想让她加入
We're just gonna fill her in.

218
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,694
-嘿！ -嗨 家人！
-Hey! -Hi, homey!

219
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,796

221
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,766
我做得很好 有点疼 但我基本上很好
I'm doing good, slightly sore, but I'm mostly good.

222
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:18,738
如果他今天赢了 他将在几周内挑战一百万美元
If he wins today, he competes for a million dollars in a challenge in a few weeks.

223
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,808
所以 如果他处理得当 他可能成为百万富翁
So, if he plays his cards right, he could become a millionaire.

224
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:24,544
所以我希望你能鼓励他 给他一些动力
So I want you to just encourage him and give him some motivation.

225
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,445
我把手机还他
I'm gonna hand him back.

226
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:30,349
继续摇摆 继续前进 只是 呃 不管它有多长
Keep swinging, keep going, it's just, uh, however long it is.

227
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,551
别担心
Don't worry about it.

228
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,385

除了佩顿每个人都有一点动力

231
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,458

00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,774
如果你现在出去 你可以得到所有的礼物
If you get out now, you can have all the presents.

239
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,143
马库斯！

240
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,744
-马库斯睡着了 -熟睡

241
00:07:58,744 --> 00:07:59,612

谢谢你能来 你知道我在说什么吗？
Appreciate you comin' out here, you know what I'm sayin'?

246
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,489
我和马库斯在今天的挑战赛中有点起起落落
Me and Marcus had a little bit of up and downs during our challenge today.

247
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,323
是的 我们做到了 我们做到了 我们做到了
Yeah, we did, we did, we did.

248
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,025
但我想我们是在马库斯睡着的时候克服的
But I think we overcame'em when Marcus fell asleep.

249
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:14,393
我认为你是对的
I think you're right.

250
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,597
他们已经荡了12个小时了
They've been swinging for 12 hours.

251
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:19,432
12小时 12小时！
12 hours, 12 hours!

252
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,634

253
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,570
我觉得你们两个都要去一段时间
I have a feeling you're both gonna go a while.

254
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,605
你会这么说吗？
Would you say so?

255
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,273
我想我们会慢慢来的！
I guess we'll just do a time lapse!

256
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,080
上一个最后下落挑战最终是杰克和钱德勒的的选手
So the last to fall challenge came down to Jake's contestant and Chandler's.

257
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,048
所以这是完全相同的事情
So this is the exact same thing.

258
00:08:36,048 --> 00:08:39,685
除此之外 杰克晚上还在这里 钱德勒没有
On top of that, Jake was still here at night time, Chandler wasn't.

259
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,220
不过 改变历史 特洛伊
Change history, though, Troy.

我不知道你们这么做
I don't know you guys do this.

263
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,224

267
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:54,634

268
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,968
-我感觉很好 -早上六点
-I feel great. -At six AM in the morning.

269

270
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,437
-你本来可以去一天的 -是啊！
-You could've gone a day. -Yeah!

271
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,006
特洛伊 你还要继续吗？
Troy, you still gonna go on?

272
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:03,876
稍微离开一点 守着桌子 但你就在那里 还是你只是在拖？
A little off, guard the table, but that's where you are, or are you just dragging?

273
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:04,744
我快疯了
I'm going off beat.

274
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,078
让我咨询一下团队
Lemme consult the team.

275
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,383
我想和队员商量 但队员们都睡着了
I wanted to consult with the team, but the team's asleep.

276
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:14,153
我可能提供一些钱 你知道 看看谁要去拿
I might offer some money, you know, to see who takes it.

277
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,588
好吧 我们试试钱德勒
Okay, let's try Chandler.

278
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:19,292
我们给他们钱 看有没有人想退出
We're offering them money to see if anyone wants to get out.

279
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:22,895
你想来劝你的人留下来吗？
Do you wanna come talk your guy into staying?

280
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,163
他好像睡着了
He's like, asleep.

281
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,097
可以
Okay.

282
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:26,832
所以我们叫醒了杰克 我们叫醒了钱德勒
So we woke up Jake, and we woke up Chandler.

283
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,401
现在我们去引诱他们一些钱
Now let's go offer them some money.

284
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,405
恭喜你 你醒了
Congratulations, you're awake.

285
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,406
你知道我们是怎么做事的
You know how we do things.

286
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:37,710
有时候人们只需要一点点的推动就可以离开 你同意吗 钱德勒？
Sometimes people just need a little bit of a nudge to get out, would you agree, Chandler?

287
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:38,578
对
Yes.

288
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,881
在接下来的30秒里 如果有人出去 $1万美元
For the next 30 seconds, if someone gets out, $10, 000.

289
00:09:41,881 --> 00:09:43,149
-一万 -那可是一大笔钱
-10, 000. -That's a lot of money.

290
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:45,585
奥马尔 我知道你想要$1万美元
Omar, I know you want this $10, 000.

291
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,853
-不 我没有 -你能用它买什么？
-Nah, I don't. -What could you buy with it?

292
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:49,221
-我不想要 -不 我没有
-I don't want it. -No, I don't.

293
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,624
我要拿一百万 我从一开始就决定了
I'm going for the million, and I decided that from the start.

294
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:52,692
你在想什么 特洛伊？
What's going through your mind, Troy?

295
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:54,427
我想要一百万 伙计
I wanna get that one mil, man.

296
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,461
你想得到一百万吗？
You wanna get the million?

297
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:58,831
但即使你在这里赢了 你还是要在这之后再赢一场挑战
But even if you win here, you still have to win another challenge after this.

298
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,702
你不可能在同一个场景中赢得比赛 但你可以少受点苦
You could not win that and be in the same scenario, but with way less suffering.

299
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:05,137
是啊 奥马尔 你脸上一直挂着微笑
Yeah, Omar, you've had a smile on your face this whole time.

300
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:07,039
是啊 当你赢的时候为什么不笑着去做呢？
Yeah, why not do it with a smile when you're winning?

301
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,308
你现在会接受这笔交易吗？
Would you have taken that deal now?

302
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,043
来吧奥马尔 让我赢吧 伙计
C'mon Omar, just let me win, man.

303
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,314
布鲁 我明天才离开 你想留下就留下
Bruh, I'm not leaving 'til tomorrow, you can stay if you want to.

304
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,517
相信我 我这么说 你是在浪费时间 我不会走的
Trust me when I say this, you're wasting your time, I'm not leaving.

305
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,653
你的能量 我想要 我需要！
The energy you have, I want that, I need that!

306
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:23,522
你准备好了吗？
Are you givin' up?

307
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,757
老兄 我现在要崩溃了
Dude, I'm breaking right now.

308
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:25,925
别 老兄 别摔坏了
Do not, dude, don't break.

309
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,228
我身体上很痛
I am physically, like, hurting so bad.

310
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:30,196
特洛伊
Troy.

311
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,064
你感觉怎么样？
How are you feeling?

312
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:33,232
我受伤了
I'm hurting.

313
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,200
可以
Okay.

314
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,835
我看得出你很伤心
I can tell you're hurting.

315
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:42,108
所以如果有人在接下来的30秒内离开 我将给他们$1万美元的现金
So if someone gets out in the next 30 seconds, I will give them $10, 000 in cash.

316
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,977
如果我赢了一百万 我就给他百分之一的奖金
I'm gonna give him one percent of my winnings if I win the million.

317
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:46,379
哦 我没听到！-我告诉他了
Oh, I didn't hear that!- I told him that.

318
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,449
如果奥马尔赢了 他将面对阿基拉和接下来两个挑战的赢家
If Omar wins, he's gonna face up against Akira and the winners of the next two challenges

319
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:52,018
-赢了这件事 -为了一百万美元
-And win off this thing. -For a million dollars.

320
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:55,421
你可以得到1万美元 你可能还会得到1万美元
You get 10 grand, and you can potentially get another 10 grand.

321
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,257
哥们 我至少还能再呆一天
Dude, I could go for at least one more day.

322
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,228
特洛伊 好吧 再给他30秒
Troy, all right, give him another 30 seconds.

323
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,330
一百万 你听到了 我需要它
A million, you heard it, I need it.

324
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,898
这就是决心
This is determination right there.

325
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,466
继续战斗 继续战斗
Keep fightin', keep fightin'.

326
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:09,468
奥马尔——我活下来了
Omar is--- I'm surviving.

327
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,436
好吧 特洛伊
All right, Troy.

328
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:12,071
坚持下去
Stick it out and go,

329
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:15,007
或者你今天可以带着2万块钱离开
or you could walk away today with 20 grand.

330
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,476
我知道那会对你的家庭有很大帮助
I know that would help your family greatly.

331
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:21,914
所以奥马尔现在在$1万美元的基础上再加上2%
So Omar has now offered two percent on top of the $10, 000.

332
00:11:21,914 --> 00:11:25,451
由于你们有些人的数学不是很好 如果他赢了一百万美元
And since some of you aren't that good with math, if he wins a million dollars,

333
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,721
百分之二看起来不算多 但仍然是2万美元
two percent might not seem like a lot, but that's still 20 grand.

334
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,289
我感觉不太好
I'm not feeling so good.

335
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:34,727
如果他起来了 好吧 如果你想不想继续的话 完全取决于你
If he gets up, okay, 100% up to you if you wanna keep going or not.

336
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:42,535
奥马尔是赢家！
Omar is the winner!

337
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,404
我们打个平局吧！
Let's have a draw!

338
00:11:45,404 --> 00:11:46,238
你没有--
You didn't--

339
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,073
我都不知道该说什么 伙计
I don't even know what to say, man.

340
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:47,907
你杀了它
You killed it.

341
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,608
你得到了一万块的保证
You got guaranteed 10 grand.

342
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,078
如果奥马尔赢了 你还有20分
If Omar wins, you get another 20.

343
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:54,013
我知道这肯定会有帮助
And I know that'll help for sure.

344
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,314
所以 我为你感到骄傲
So, I'm proud of you.

345
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:56,882
每个人都为你骄傲
Everyone's proud of you.

346
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,418
你妈妈 你的家人肯定会为你骄傲的
Your mom, your family's gonna be proud of you for sure.

347
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:01,921
是的 我在这里感觉好多了
Yeah, I feel better up here.

348
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:06,325
我真的很想赢球 打破那种连败的感觉
I really wanted to win it to break, you know, the losing streak.

349
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,293
这就是为什么？
That's why?

350
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:08,260
这就是为什么？
That's why?

351
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,397
好吧 我很感激你帮我 伙计 但那太棒了
Well, I appreciate you trying for me, man, but that was awesome.

352
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,567
你现在就可以拿到$1万美元了
And you're gonna get that $10, 000 now.

353
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:18,404
我要感谢我的粉丝和我的家人

我肯定会给你$2万美元的 兄弟

355
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,209
100% 你会得到$2万美元
100%, you'll gain that $20K.

356
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,612
-杰克 阿基拉赢了 -是的
-Jake, Akira won. -Yes.

357
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,614
奥马尔赢了 你两个赢了
Omar won, you're two for two.

358
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,448
两个哦
Two and oh.

359
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,752
这意味着四个人中的两个将是你的人
Which means two of the four people competing for a million dollars will be your guys.

360
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,887
说实话 一百万对我来说意义重大
Honestly, one million means a lot to me.

361
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:37,323
就像 我的家人一辈子都在照顾我
