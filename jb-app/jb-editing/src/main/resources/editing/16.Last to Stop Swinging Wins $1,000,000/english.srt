1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:01,708
- We are doing four last to leave videos,

2
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:03,828
and the winners of each are
competing in a fifth one

3
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:05,020
for one million dollars.
(cash register chimes)

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,350
You are currently watching
video number two of this series.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,892
So the first one was last to fall.

6
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,880
Last to fall went for over 30 hours!

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,550
A million dollars!

8
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,383
It's a lot!

9
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,192
This is Nick, and his coach is Chris.

10
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:17,653
They have matching shirts.
- Yeah!

11
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:19,332
- We gonna win it!
- We gonna win!

12
00:00:19,332 --> 00:00:21,544
- This is Omar and his coach is Jake.

13
00:00:21,544 --> 00:00:25,148
This is Troy and his coach is
coming off a couple losses.

14
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:25,981
- [Man] Bruh!

15
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,339
- And this is Payton
and his coach is Marcus.

16
00:00:28,339 --> 00:00:30,804
One of their body parts
must cross this line

17
00:00:30,804 --> 00:00:31,897
for it to count as a swing.

18
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:33,231
If they don't, we have a ref.

19
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,167
(squealing)

20
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:35,189
If they don't cross it,

21
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,022
they're not out,

22
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:38,214
but what'll determine if
they're making an effort.

23
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:39,309
- I'm very distressed.

24
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:41,220
(smooth hip-hop music)

25
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,179
- Give you a dollar to get out.

26
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,966
You guys could split it, 50 cents.

27
00:00:43,966 --> 00:00:44,799
- Yoink!

28
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,760
- Good thing I have another dollar.

29
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,168
- I'll give you two if you stay.

30
00:00:47,168 --> 00:00:48,318
(energetic funky music)

31
00:00:48,318 --> 00:00:49,497
- We're gonna prank our cameraman.

32
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:50,957
Hit three!

33
00:00:50,957 --> 00:00:51,809
(air horn)

34
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:52,910
(laughing)

35
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,086
- That was scary.

36
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:54,982
I can't hear now.

37
00:00:54,982 --> 00:00:56,607
- We're doing the first challenge!

38
00:00:56,607 --> 00:00:58,399
Stay behind that bag of chips.

39
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,340
Here's a marshmallow.

40
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,645
If you land it in his mouth,

41
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,843
you get to push him for a minute.

42
00:01:02,843 --> 00:01:03,676
- [Chandler] What is that?

43
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:04,539
(buzzer)
- Oh!

44
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:05,795
(groaning)
- What is what?

45
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:06,628
What is what?

46
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:07,834
Yeah, yeah, come on!

47
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,625
- [Angry Man] Boy, if you don't get--

48
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,458
(buzzer)
- Wait--

49
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:11,291
- Wow!

50
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,840
This is where everyone else was.

51
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,058
Since you're Chandler, you can go up here.

52
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:16,891
- Ooh!

53
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:17,724
(groans)

54
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:18,557
- [Jimmy] And you're not Chandler,

55
00:01:18,557 --> 00:01:19,390
so you're back here.
- What?

56
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,223
(laughing)

57
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:21,378
- Here you go!
- All right.

58
00:01:21,378 --> 00:01:22,276
- Kobe!

59
00:01:22,276 --> 00:01:24,105
(ding)
(shouting)

60
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:25,328
Let's go!

61
00:01:25,328 --> 00:01:27,082
- Now that he's pushing you, is it easier?

62
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:27,915
- Tons easier.

63
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,040
- I wanna make sure I'm very clear,

64
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,198
you guys cannot touch the contestants

65
00:01:31,198 --> 00:01:32,915
or the red lights will
be forced to come on.

66
00:01:32,915 --> 00:01:34,641
- Oh, oh!
- Look at this,

67
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:35,688
I'm not touching him!

68
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,318
Ooh, look at me!

69
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:38,680
- Oh hey, look at that, Troy, Marcus,

70
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,513
can't touch him.

71
00:01:39,513 --> 00:01:40,440
- [Uneasy Man] No, no, no--

72
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,422
- Did he get you?

73
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:42,255
Did he get you?

74
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:43,088
- Yeah, he got me.

75
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:43,921
- Troy touched Chris.

76
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:44,754
Let me show you what happens

77
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:46,735
if a contestant touches one of you.

78
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:48,206
(ripping)

79
00:01:48,206 --> 00:01:49,195
- Oh my--
- Oh my God!

80
00:01:49,195 --> 00:01:50,082
- [Chris] There is no way!

81
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:51,217
- See how Nick is suffering?

82
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:53,089
This is why you guys shouldn't touch them.

83
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,142
I don't know if you're out there,

84
00:01:54,142 --> 00:01:57,029
if they swing and just touch
you with their toenail.

85
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:57,862
- Like that?

86
00:01:57,862 --> 00:01:58,695
- But did you?

87
00:01:58,695 --> 00:01:59,528
- Yes!

88
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:00,624
- Jake just got touched!

89
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:02,251
Hey, I won't move yours as far.

90
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,569
We'll put his right here.

91
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:06,680
And I think it's time to move his back.

92
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,185
There we go, now he's back to normal.

93
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,301
- Troy, we don't wanna
just pick on you, so--

94
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,135
(air horn)

95
00:02:11,135 --> 00:02:11,987
♪ Oh my God ♪

96
00:02:11,987 --> 00:02:13,311
(air horn)

97
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:15,141
(laughing)

98
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:16,612
- Yo!
(claps)

99
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:18,765
(smooth hip-hop music)

100
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,722
- You can't go too deep,
I'm telling you now, bro,

101
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:21,693
it's going on two days.

102
00:02:21,693 --> 00:02:22,526
- [Cameraman] You know you're saying that

103
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:23,359
you have to win now.

104
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:24,981
- No one's gonna last more
than a day after, like--

105
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:25,814
- [Cameraman] Interesting.

106
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:26,647
- I'm gonna win in a day.

107
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,068
- You have to run through
them without getting touched.

108
00:02:29,068 --> 00:02:31,351
We're gonna use the smoke to
make it harder for them to see.

109
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,458
Hut, hut, hike, go!

110
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:36,336
(aggressive rock music)

111
00:02:36,336 --> 00:02:37,169
- [Blunt Man] Nope!

112
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,636
(shouting)
- Was it?

113
00:02:38,636 --> 00:02:39,871
Jake, you got touched!

114
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:41,622
- Yeah, Frankie! (growling)

115
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,039
- Hut, hut, hike!

116
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,204
Give him more!

117
00:02:45,204 --> 00:02:46,037
Give him--

118
00:02:46,037 --> 00:02:46,870
He got him!

119
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,895
Chandler, are you ready?

120
00:02:48,895 --> 00:02:49,757
- Hey, no!

121
00:02:49,757 --> 00:02:50,896
- Hike!

122
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,159
- Ow, fumble!

123
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:52,992
(beep)

124
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:54,159
- To hike 2.0.

125
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:56,274
- Ooh!

126
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,024
- He hurt to himself.

127
00:02:58,907 --> 00:03:00,465
So, the punishment is you have to lay

128
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:02,459
under your contestant for five minutes.

129
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:05,312
- I feel like my ding dong's
gonna get kicked any second.

130
00:03:05,312 --> 00:03:06,435
- Oh, this kinda nice, actually.

131
00:03:06,435 --> 00:03:07,268
- You know what?

132
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:08,192
- I'm a great motivator.

133
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:09,772
- So now that you guys are
all laying on the ground,

134
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,818
this leads perfectly
into our next segment.

135
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,939
Chris, I need you hold this
and let your guy punt it.

136
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:15,772
- All right.

137
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:16,712
- Distance.
(thunks) (ding)

138
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:18,295
- Whoa!
- It's good!

139
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,899
(ding)
(shouting)

140
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,118
- Shut up, I need your help, dude.

141
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:22,951
(ding)

142
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:24,477
- It's good!

143
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:26,450
(shouting)
(buzzer)

144
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,124
- Marcus, just stay under him.

145
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,106
- It's not fair.

146
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:30,492
He pushed it up closer for Chandler,

147
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:31,432
but not for me!

148
00:03:31,432 --> 00:03:33,266
- [Jimmy] You should just get
good, have you tried that?

149
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,485
- [Loud Man] Got him! (laughs)

150
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:36,521
(squealing)

151
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:37,354
- Ad on the field,

152
00:03:37,354 --> 00:03:39,187
we have an ad on the field!

153
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:40,020
- Thank you, referee.

154
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,189
Now let me tell you about the
sponsor of the video, Honey.

155
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,181
Here is how Honey works.

156
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,403
We're currently on Macy's,

157
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:46,680
we have a $279 mixer,

158
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,861
and we're gonna add it to our bag.

159
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:49,085
Because we have the Honey add-on,

160
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,709
all we have to do is hit apply coupon

161
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,337
when checking out on any website.

162
00:03:52,337 --> 00:03:54,466
And boom, Honey actually
found a coupon code

163
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:55,759
that saved us 50 bucks.
(cash register chimes)

164
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,216
And that, in a nutshell,
is how Honey works.

165
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:59,221
Anytime you check out on your computer,

166
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,888
it will search the entire internet,

167
00:04:00,888 --> 00:04:02,199
and if it finds a coupon code,

168
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,052
it will apply it.

169
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:04,111
Here's another example.

170
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,307
Our total is $425.

171
00:04:06,307 --> 00:04:07,373
We hit apply coupon.

172
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:08,553
Now it's $340.
(cash register chimes)

173
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,920
We saved $85 by literally clicking twice

174
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,791
and installing a free browser add-on.

175
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:14,055
Here's how you install Honey.

176
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,046
You hit add to Chrome,
you hit add extension,

177
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:16,879
now you have Honey.

178
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,031
Even Chandler can do it!

179
00:04:18,031 --> 00:04:19,648
- Here and here!

180
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:20,482
- Nice!
(claps)

181
00:04:20,482 --> 00:04:22,418
And here's a list of all
the websites Honey works on.

182
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:23,394
You should really install it

183

'cause you'll save thousands
of dollars of your live time.

184
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:27,881
Go to JoinHoney.com/MrBeast.

185
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:30,524
That's JoinHoney.com/MrBeast,

00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:31,739
you'll save a lot of money.

187
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,122
And let's go back to swinging.

188
00:04:33,122 --> 00:04:36,181
(smooth hip-hop music)

189
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:38,410
So this challenge has
been goin' on for a while.

190
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,345
- Quite some time.
- Yeah.

191
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,180
- I think it's time we bring
out the Unicorn of Wealth.

192
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,590
Plop the Unicorn of Wealth right here.

193
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,204
We have some Beats, rip off of AirPods,

194
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,343
AirPods,

195
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:48,885
we have an iPad,

196
00:04:48,885 --> 00:04:49,718
a speaker,

197
00:04:49,718 --> 00:04:51,917
and an Alienware laptop

198
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,705
here for the next person that gets up.

199
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:55,062
The laptop's worth two grand.

200
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,766
I know you wanna get out
now, go ahead and grab it.

201
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:57,861
- No, I am stayin'.

202
00:04:57,861 --> 00:04:58,694
- [Jimmy] Okay.

203
00:04:58,694 --> 00:04:59,527
- Not that there.
- Not that?

204
00:04:59,527 --> 00:05:00,360
- Not that.

205
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,193
- [Jimmy] Oh, not, Marcus!

206
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:02,082
He just said not that,

207
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,340
but he said something bigger.

208
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,501
You might wanna have to
go have a talk with him.

209
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:07,867
You wanna be the first one
out two times in a row?

210
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:08,820
- It's not happening.

211
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,289
- There's a lot of good stuff in there.

212
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:11,990
- Oh no, not interested at all.

213
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,530
- [Jimmy] Mr. Nick, I can tell.

214
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,711
- Guy ain't even a PC gamer.

215
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:15,544
He don't want that--

216
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:16,662
- [Jimmy] Nick, go grab it.

217
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:18,391
- It's nice, but can't take it.

218
00:05:18,391 --> 00:05:20,786
(smooth hip-hop music)

219
00:05:20,786 --> 00:05:21,619
- [Jimmy] What'd you just say?

220
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:23,106
I know, Aardman, who's
gonna get out first.

221
00:05:23,106 --> 00:05:23,999
Is that what this is right now?

222
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:27,004
- I'm doing a business
deal, and we're gone.

223
00:05:27,004 --> 00:05:27,837
- [Jimmy] A business deal and you're gone?

224
00:05:27,837 --> 00:05:28,895
- A business deal and we're gone.

225
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:29,751
- [Jimmy] You, what?

226
00:05:29,751 --> 00:05:30,607
Now, here's my question.

227
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:33,474
Are you gonna beat him to
the punch and get off first?

228
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:34,646
- I'm already on the ground.

229
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,065
- [Jimmy] You're already-- (laughing)

230
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:37,245
So you're sayin' you're ready to go.

231
00:05:37,245 --> 00:05:40,434
- The way these legs hurting right now--

232
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,850
- [Cameraman] So, Nick,

233
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,485
you openly said you're struggling, right?

234
00:05:43,485 --> 00:05:44,318
- I'm struggling right now.

235
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:45,578
- [Jimmy] So here's the thing.

236
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,225
Before I make an offer,
I wanna remind you.

237
00:05:48,225 --> 00:05:49,691
One million dollars.

238
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:52,618
You could work the next
15 years of your life

239
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,881
and make a million dollars.

240
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:55,886
Or you could push through
and win it in a few weeks,

241
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,189
when we have the next challenge.

242
00:05:57,189 --> 00:06:00,516
Having said that, $5,000
to the first person.

243
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:01,349
(record scratch)

244
00:06:01,349 --> 00:06:02,912
(shouting)
Oh!

245
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:03,745
Okay!

246
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:06,137
Chris, that's two challenges you lost.

247
00:06:06,137 --> 00:06:08,007
- I gave him linguini!

248
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,921
I couldn't have been a better coach!

249
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:11,393
- [Cameraman] You got offered $5,000.

250
00:06:11,393 --> 00:06:12,976
- My legs hurt so bad.

251
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:14,121
- [Cameraman] How do you feel now?

252
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,722
- I feel like my legs are
in bad shape right now.

253
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:18,104
- [Cameraman] Was it the right decision?

254
00:06:18,104 --> 00:06:19,895
- Yes, for my legs!

255
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:21,324
- All right, come here, Nick, come on.

256
00:06:21,324 --> 00:06:22,349
Come over here to the couch.

257
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:23,243
Let's escort him.

258
00:06:23,243 --> 00:06:24,264
Oh, hey Chandler.

259
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,097
Did you wake up from your nap?

260
00:06:25,097 --> 00:06:25,930
(grunts)

261
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,085
Here you go, this should
ease your pain, $5,000.

262
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,344
- Cool.

263
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:29,764
- [Jimmy] You didn't
win a million dollars,

264
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:30,938
but you got five grand.

265
00:06:30,938 --> 00:06:32,050
- [Chris] How do they feel?

266
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,769
- Dude, they hurt so bad.
- Do they?

267
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,275
- The way you sit on it, it's like,

268
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,827
it's like digging into right here.

269
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:38,700
Think I have a bruise
right here, actually.

270
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,756
- Geez.

271
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:41,092
- [Jimmy] Payton, you already sound

272
00:06:41,092 --> 00:06:42,088
like you're on the edge, so--

273
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:44,137
- That wasn't the business
deal I was looking for,

274
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,810
I'd just stick up the gum.

275
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,411
- [Jimmy] So we already
know, Payton's struggling.

276
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:49,405
Tony, it's really you against Omar.

277
00:06:49,405 --> 00:06:51,561
Are you gonna be the one
that stands up to him

278
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:52,801
and wins a million dollars?

279
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:53,634
- Yes.

280
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:54,840
- [Jimmy] 'Cause if Omar wins,

281
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,061
that means Jake's contestant

282
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,174
would've won the first
challenge and the second.

283
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,086
- I feel like I don't
really have much pain.

284
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,806
- [Jimmy] If you win the million dollars,

285
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,787
what would you buy with it?

286
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:05,390
- Firstly, I'd give back to
my whole family, my parents.

287
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,730
$200K I'm gonna keep to spend.

288
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,674
- Oh, only 200 grand?
- Only 200.

289
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:11,035
- Now we're gonna call all
the contestants' parents.

290
00:07:11,035 --> 00:07:12,546
We're gonna start off
with Payton's father.

291
00:07:12,546 --> 00:07:14,610
- [Automated Message] I'm
sorry, the person you are try--

292
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,676
(somber piano music)

293
00:07:16,676 --> 00:07:18,219
- Now we're gonna call Troy's mom.

294
00:07:18,219 --> 00:07:19,761
Hey, are you Troy's mother?

295
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,674
- [Troy's Mom] Yes.

296
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,725
- He's been swinging on
a swing for 10 hours,

297
00:07:22,725 --> 00:07:25,582
and if he wins, he gets to
compete for a million dollars.

298
00:07:25,582 --> 00:07:26,654
- [Troy's Mom] Just hold on, boo.

299
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:27,718
Just don't think about it,

300
00:07:27,718 --> 00:07:28,551
just keep swinging.

301
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,384
- Aw.

302
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,217
- [Troy's Mom] Just go with the flow.

303
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,050
- How's dad doin'?

304
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,937
Is he getting any better?

305
00:07:31,937 --> 00:07:35,231
- [Troy's Mom] Yes, they
shocked his heart to restart it,

306
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:37,675
and then that makes him
feel back to normal.

307
00:07:37,675 --> 00:07:39,988
So, I'm gonna go and
tell him what's going on.

308
00:07:39,988 --> 00:07:43,037
Just concentrate and then
don't think about, like,

309
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:44,271
oh, I'm tired, or something.

310
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:45,104
Just don't think about it.

311
00:07:45,104 --> 00:07:45,937
- No.

312
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:47,474
- [Troy's Mom] Just hang in there, baby.

313
00:07:47,474 --> 00:07:48,847
- Oh, now I want you to win.

314
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,574
Omar, get out!
- No!

315
00:07:50,574 --> 00:07:51,407
- Okay.

316
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:52,432
We're gonna hit the phone
with the next contestant,

317
00:07:52,432 --> 00:07:53,744
we'll update you on how he does.

318
00:07:53,744 --> 00:07:54,821
- [Troy's Mom] Okay, thank you.

319
00:07:54,821 --> 00:07:56,145
- All right, all right, later, mom.

320
00:07:56,145 --> 00:07:57,610
- [Troy's Mom] I love you, son.

321
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,713
- All right, all right.

322
00:07:58,713 --> 00:07:59,745
- [Troy's Mom] Okay, go hard.

323
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,661
- Oh.
- I will.

324
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,328
- All right, wow.

325
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:05,037
Omar's about to call his sister.

326
00:08:05,037 --> 00:08:05,967
We're just gonna fill her in.

327
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,171
- Hey!
- Hi, homey!

328
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:08,275
- Hey, hey.

329
00:08:08,275 --> 00:08:09,784
So I'm currently swinging.

330
00:08:09,784 --> 00:08:11,218
I'm doing good, slightly sore,

331
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:12,232
but I'm mostly good.

332
00:08:12,232 --> 00:08:13,660
- If he wins today,

333
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,700
he competes for a million dollars

334
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,222
in a challenge in a few weeks.

335
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:18,866
So, if he plays his cards right,

336
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,293
he could become a millionaire.

337
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:21,848
So I want you to just encourage him

338
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,029
and give him some motivation.

339
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:23,878
I'm gonna hand him back.

340
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,186
- Keep swinging, keep going,

341
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:28,836
it's just, uh, however long it is.

342
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:30,016
- [Omar] Don't worry about it.

343
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:30,849
Talk to you soon.

344
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:31,682
- Call me after.

345
00:08:31,682 --> 00:08:32,515
- Yes, I will.

346
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:34,739
- Everyone just got a
little bit of motivation

347
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:36,077
except for Payton.

348
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:36,909
- You know what?

349
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,755
We're swingin'!
- Yeah!

350
00:08:37,756 --> 00:08:39,510
- So just keep swingin'!

351
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,654
- Yeah!

352
00:08:40,655 --> 00:08:41,635
- [Coach] Whoo!

353
00:08:41,635 --> 00:08:43,782
(smooth hip-hop music)

354
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:46,964
- Chris, my brother, can you
cart Steve onto the court?

355
00:08:46,964 --> 00:08:47,797
- Uh-oh.

356
00:08:49,621 --> 00:08:53,240
- If you get out now, you
can have all the presents.

357
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,387
(shouting)

358
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:55,613
Marcus!

359
00:08:55,613 --> 00:08:57,224
Marcus is asleep.
- Sound asleep.

360
00:08:57,224 --> 00:08:58,079
- Hey buddy.

361
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,627
You know how we're recording these?

362
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:01,379
See how do y'all rate?

363
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:02,830
- You did the best you could do.

364
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,400
Appreciate you comin' out
here, you know what I'm sayin'?

365
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,878
- Me and Marcus had a
little bit of up and downs

366
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:07,972
during our challenge today.

367
00:09:07,972 --> 00:09:08,805
- Yeah, we did, we did, we did.

368
00:09:08,805 --> 00:09:11,515
- But I think we overcame
'em when Marcus fell asleep.

369
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:12,858
- I think you're right.
(laughing)

370
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:16,060
- They've been swinging for 12 hours.

371
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:17,906
- 12 hours, 12 hours!

372
00:09:17,906 --> 00:09:19,000
(bursts)

373
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,100
- Ooh, that was nice.

374
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,030
I have a feeling you're
both gonna go a while.

375
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,089
Would you say so?

376
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:24,922
I guess we'll just

377
00:09:24,922 --> 00:09:25,755
do a time lapse!

378
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:28,487
(smooth hip-hop music)

379
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:29,667
So the last to fall challenge

380
00:09:29,667 --> 00:09:31,381
came down to Jake's contestant

381
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,560
and Chandler's.

382
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,511
So this is the exact same thing.

383
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,513
On top of that,

384
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:37,184
Jake was still here at nighttime,

385
00:09:37,184 --> 00:09:38,160
Chandler wasn't.

386
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,706
Change history, though, Troy.

387
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:40,539
I believe.

388
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,372
- I will change it.

389
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,481
- I don't know you guys do this.

390
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,706
I'm tired.
(chuckles)

391
00:09:43,706 --> 00:09:46,481
(smooth hip-hop music)

392
00:09:46,481 --> 00:09:47,564
It is six AM.

393
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:50,053
I now you guys have to be tired.

394
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:51,397
- I'm feeling great, Jimmy.

395
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,107
- I don't get how he feels like that.

396
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:54,450
- I feel great.
- At six AM in the morning.

397
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,355
- I feel great, dude, I feel great.

398
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:56,910
- You could've gone a day.
- Yeah!

399
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,494
- Troy, you still gonna go on?

400
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,832
A little off, guard the table,

401
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,855
but that's where you are,

402
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:02,337
or are you just dragging?

403
00:10:02,337 --> 00:10:03,224
- I'm going off beat.

404
00:10:03,224 --> 00:10:04,562
- Lemme consult the team.

405
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,944
I wanted to consult with the team,

406
00:10:06,944 --> 00:10:08,854
but the team's asleep.

407
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,299
I might offer some money, you know,

408
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:12,634
to see who takes it.

409
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:14,062
Okay, let's try Chandler.

410
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:16,146
We're offering them money

411
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:17,780
to see if anyone wants to get out.

412
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,375
Do you wanna come talk
your guy into staying?

413
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,642
He's like, asleep.

414
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:23,584
Okay.

415
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:25,293
So we woke up Jake, and
we woke up Chandler.

416
00:10:25,293 --> 00:10:26,880
Now let's go offer them some money.

417
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,330
(squealing)

418
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,890
- Congratulations, you're awake.

419
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,876
- You know how we do things.

420
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:33,542
Sometimes people just need a little bit

421
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:36,190
of a nudge to get out,
would you agree, Chandler?

422
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,023
- Yes.

423
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:38,037
- For the next 30 seconds,

424
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,053
if someone gets out,

425
00:10:39,053 --> 00:10:40,370
$10,000.

426
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,627
- 10,000.
- That's a lot of money.

427
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:44,037
- Omar, I know you want this $10,000.

428
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:44,870
- Nah, I don't.

429
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,313
- What could you buy with it?
(laughing)

430
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:47,704
- I don't want it.
- No, I don't.

431
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:48,765
- [Omar] I'm going for the million,

432
00:10:48,765 --> 00:10:50,100
and I decided that from the start.

433
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,160
- What's going through your mind, Troy?

434
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,913
- [Troy] I wanna get that one mil, man.

435
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:53,925
- You wanna get the million?

436
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:54,817
But even if you win here,

437
00:10:54,817 --> 00:10:57,308
you still have to win
another challenge after this.

438
00:10:57,308 --> 00:10:58,489
You could not win that

439
00:10:58,489 --> 00:10:59,589
and be in the same scenario,

440
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:01,175
but with way less suffering.

441
00:11:01,175 --> 00:11:02,772
- [Cameraman] Yeah, Omar,
you've had a smile on your face

442
00:11:02,772 --> 00:11:03,605
this whole time.

443
00:11:03,605 --> 00:11:05,528
- Yeah, why not do it with
a smile when you're winning?

444
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,797
- [Cameraman] Would you
have taken that deal now?

445
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,517
- C'mon Omar, just let me win, man.

446
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,350
(laughs)

447
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,175
- Bruh, I'm not leaving 'til tomorrow,

448
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,775
you can stay if you want to.

449
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:16,046
Trust me when I say this,
you're wasting your time,

450
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:17,007
I'm not leaving.

451
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:19,128
- [Jimmy] The energy you have,
I want that, I need that!

452
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:21,092
(laughing)

453
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,002
- [Chandler] Are you givin' up?

454
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:23,223
- Dude, I'm breaking right now.

455
00:11:23,223 --> 00:11:24,408
- [Chandler] Do not, dude, don't break.

456
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:27,719
- I am physically, like, hurting so bad.

457
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:28,669
- Troy.

458
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,539
How are you feeling?

459
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:31,708
- I'm hurting.

460
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,691
- Okay.

461
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,319
I can tell you're hurting.

462
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,607
So if someone gets out
in the next 30 seconds,

463
00:11:37,607 --> 00:11:40,584
I will give them $10,000 in cash.

464
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:42,615
- I'm gonna give him one
percent of my winnings

465
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:43,448
if I win the million.

466
00:11:43,448 --> 00:11:44,867
- Oh, I didn't hear that!
- I told him that.

467
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:47,604
- If Omar wins, he's gonna
face up against Akira

468
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:48,941
and the winners of the
next two challenges--

469
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,483
- And win off this thing.
- For a million dollars.

470
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:51,947
You get 10 grand,

471
00:11:51,947 --> 00:11:53,903
and you can potentially
get another 10 grand.

472
00:11:53,903 --> 00:11:56,726
- Dude, I could go for
at least one more day.

473
00:11:56,726 --> 00:11:58,398
(laughing)

474
00:11:58,398 --> 00:12:00,711
- Troy, all right, give
him another 30 seconds.

475
00:12:00,711 --> 00:12:02,809
- A million, you heard it, I need it.

476
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:04,359
- [Jimmy] This is
determination right there.

477
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:05,948
- [Chandler] Keep fightin', keep fightin'.

478
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:07,933
Omar is--
- I'm surviving.

479
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:08,910
- All right, Troy.

480
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,552
Stick it out and go,

481
00:12:10,552 --> 00:12:13,481
or you could walk away
today with 20 grand.

482
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,967
I know that would help
your family greatly.

483
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:18,575
So Omar has now offered two percent

484
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:20,404
on top of the $10,000.

485
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:22,533
- And since some of you
aren't that good with math,

486
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:23,917
if he wins a million dollars,

487
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,364
two percent might not seem like a lot,

488
00:12:25,364 --> 00:12:27,195
but that's still 20 grand.

489
00:12:27,195 --> 00:12:28,752
- I'm not feeling so good.

490
00:12:28,752 --> 00:12:30,628
- If he gets up, okay, 100% up to you

491
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:33,211
if you wanna keep going or not.

492
00:12:34,398 --> 00:12:36,815
(applauding)

493
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:41,014
Omar is the winner!

494
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:43,895
Let's have a draw!

495
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:44,728
- You didn't--

496
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:45,561
- I don't even know what to say, man.

497
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:46,394
You killed it.

498
00:12:46,394 --> 00:12:48,075
You got guaranteed 10 grand.

499
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:50,543
If Omar wins, you get another 20.

500
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:52,499
And I know that'll help for sure.

501
00:12:52,499 --> 00:12:53,800
So, I'm proud of you.

502
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,342
Everyone's proud of you.

503
00:12:55,342 --> 00:12:57,908
Your mom, your family's gonna
be proud of you for sure.

504
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:00,395
- Yeah, I feel better up here.

505
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,101
I really wanted to win
it to break, you know,

506
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:04,794
the losing streak.
(laughs)

507
00:13:04,794 --> 00:13:05,769
- That's why?

508
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:06,744
That's why?

509
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,705
Well, I appreciate you trying for me, man,

510
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:09,881
but that was awesome.

511
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,056
And you're gonna get that $10,000 now.

512
00:13:13,056 --> 00:13:16,889
- Gotta give thanks to
my fans, and my family.

513
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:20,185
- I'mma give you that $20K, for sure, bro,

514
00:13:20,185 --> 00:13:21,692
100%, you'll gain that $20K.

515
00:13:21,692 --> 00:13:22,912
(murmuring)

516
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:25,080
- Jake, Akira won.
- Yes.

517
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
- Omar won, you're two for two.

518
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,913
- Two and oh.

519
00:13:27,913 --> 00:13:29,094
- Which means two of the
four people competing

520
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:31,209
for a million dollars will be your guys.

521
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:33,374
- Honestly, one million means a lot to me.

522
00:13:33,374 --> 00:13:35,813
And like, my family has
taken care of me all my life.

523
00:13:35,813 --> 00:13:38,296
And all I want to do is
like give back to them,

524
00:13:38,296 --> 00:13:39,800
and this seems like
the perfect opportunity

525
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,048
through, like, getting a million.

526
00:13:41,048 --> 00:13:43,189
- Based on the comments
section up in the last video,

527
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:44,542
people really like Akira.

528
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:46,549
Well, we'll see how they
respond to you, Omar.

529
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:47,783
And we'll see you in a few weeks.

530
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:48,616

00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:51,449
