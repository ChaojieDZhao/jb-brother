1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,490
所以你总是说你睡不好，也不知道为什么，
So you say you don't sleep well and you don't know why

2
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:08,269
因为你感觉良好，平时也做了所有正确的事来获得一个像样的睡眠。
because you feel good and do all the right things in your life to get a decent night's sleep.

3
00:00:08,468 --> 00:00:12,410
你所不知道的是，你实际上并没有做那些有助于
What you don't know is that you actually don't do the things that are conducive to

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,890
能迸发出快速眼动（深睡眠的最高形态）的坚实八小时的事情。
getting a solid eight hours with those needed spurts of rapid eye movement.

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,620
有些事情你甚至没有意识到会影响你进入深睡眠模式后
There are things you do that you are not even aware of that affect you getting

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:26,140
所必须的时间，而今天我们将告诉你哪里做错了。
the requisite hours in deep sleep mode, and today we are going to tell you what you're doing wrong.

7
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,250
首先，你并不孤单。
So first of all, you're not alone.

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,259
你知道吗，有研究称在美国高达60%的人
Did you know that in the USA it's reported that a whopping 60 percent of people

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,359
在大多数晚上甚至每晚都难以入睡？
have trouble sleeping most nights or even every night.

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,056
这是来自国家睡眠基金会（National Sleep Foundation）的说法，当涉及到睡眠时，
That's according to the National Sleep Foundation and when it comes to sleeping

11
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:41,649
这个组织是很有发言权的。
this organization knows what it's talking about.

12
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,939
同一项研究告诉我们，43%的人很少或者从来没有睡过好觉，
The same study tells us that 43 percent of those people rarely or never get a good night's sleep,

13
00:00:46,939 --> 00:00:49,640
好吧，至少在13到64岁的人中。
well, at least people aged 13 to 64.

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,088
他们中的很多人说一晚连6个小时的睡眠都没有，
A lot of those folks say they don't even get six hours' sleep a night,

15
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:58,769
而坊间流传的说法是，如果我们想要感觉良好，应该睡7到9个小时。
and the word on the street is we should get seven to nine hours if we want to feel good.

16
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,990
睡眠剥夺的时代已经来临，而这里有一个重要的原因。
The sleep deprivation era is here, and there is one big reason why we seem to be sleeping less.

17
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,390
那就是科技，据国家睡眠基金会报道，
The reason is technology, with the National Sleep Foundation reporting that

18
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,629
95%的人会在睡前使用某种电子设备。
95 percent of people use an electronic gadget of some kind right before bed.

19
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:16,280
额... 你是不是就打算在睡觉前看这条视频？
Hmm, are you watching this show just before you intend to sleep?

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,079
然而我们说的不仅仅只有手机，还有电视也包含在这些设备列表中。
But we are not just talking about phones, TVs are included in the list of gadgets.

21
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,890
以下是一位专家在谈到睡前使用电子设备时所说的话，
This is what one expert said about gadget use before bed,

22
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:29,023
“从傍晚到入睡之间设备发出的人造光会抑制
“Artificial light exposure between dusk and the time we go to bed at night suppresses release of

23
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:34,819
促睡眠的褪黑激素的释放，并将昼夜节律推迟一小时，
the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, enhances alertness and shifts circadian rhythms to a later hour,

24
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,679
使人更加难以入睡。”
making it more difficult to fall asleep.”

25
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,256
我们并不是说要抛弃掉电子设备，但如果你想快速入睡并且睡足8个小时，
We are not saying don't use gadgets, but perhaps if you want to get your eight hours and drift off quickly

26
00:01:42,256 --> 00:01:46,790
你可能要考虑在睡前两个小时不浏览任何电子屏幕。
you might think about not looking at a screen for the two hours before you intend to sleep.

27
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,190
一项研究表明约有60％的人说他们在上床前使用笔记本或手机
Around 60 percent of people in one study said they use their laptop or phone right before they go to bed,

28
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,756
其中的一些人也会选择打电子游戏，
and some of them play computer games

29
00:01:53,756 --> 00:01:56,530
这实际上不利于让自己感到疲惫并进入梦乡。
which is really not conducive to making yourself tired.

30
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,560
另一位睡眠专家是这样描述的：“在过去的50年里，我们已经看到
Another sleep expert said this about that, “Over the last 50 years, we've seen how

31
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,156
睡前观看电视已经成为一种常态，
television viewing has grown to be a near constant before bed,

32
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:07,056
而现在我们又看到新的信息技术，
and now we are seeing new information technologies

33
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:12,530
如笔记本电脑、手机、视频游戏和音乐设备，正迅速获得同样的地位。”
such as laptops, cell phones, video games and music devices rapidly gaining the same status.”

34
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,979
你可能认为这对你一点影响都没有，但根据专家的说法它确实有，
You might think it doesn't affect you at all, but according to those experts it does

35
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,030
而且有数据支持这个观点。
and there's data to back that up.

36
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:23,419
我们应该补充的是，关于人造光使人保持清醒的理论是有争议的，
We should add that the artificial light theory about keeping us awake is controversial

37
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,969
所以需要做更多的调查。
and so more research needs to be done.

38
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:29,719
研究显示，很多美国人在晚上不会静音手机，
According to studies a lot of Americans leave their phone alerts on during the night,

39
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,919
十分之一的受访者表示，手机有时会把他们吵醒。
and one in ten people interviewed said their phone woke them up during the night at times.

40
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,409
关闭提醒就好了，很简单的事情。
Just turn off the alerts, it's simple to do.

41
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,341
现在的问题是，很多人在网上有来自世界各地的朋友，
The problem these days is that many people have online friends all over the world,

42
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:45,050
于是当你在英国想睡觉的时候，你的美国朋友会在
so when you're trying to sleep in the UK your friends in the USA are sending you

43
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,123
微信上给你发喵星人的照片。
photos of kittens on Facebook Messenger.

44
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:51,199
可能你在亚洲有一个客户，当你想在加拿大睡觉的时候，
You might have a client in Asia who keeps posting stuff about work to you

45
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,659
他会不停地给你发一些工作上的消息。
when you're trying to sleep in Canada.

46
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:57,810
你无缘无故的惊醒，通常就是因为手机出现了状况。
You may wake up and not know why, but often it's because something went down in that phone of yours.

47
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,923
另一项研究表明，年轻人在这方面情况尤为严重，
Another study said younger folks were terrible at this,

48
00:03:00,923 --> 00:03:05,990
72%的6到17岁的美国孩子睡觉时会带着手机。
saying that 72 percent of American kids aged six to seventeen go to bed with their phone.

49
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,056
在过去，孩子们可能会和一只毛毛熊或一本书睡在一起，这些东西不会发出任何声响。
In the past kids might have slept with a furry bear or a book, and those things don't make any noise.

50
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,250
为什么现在的人觉得他们在睡觉时需要带着手机?
Why do people these days feel they need to sleep with their phone?

51
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,620
有什么重要的内容以至于如此迫不及待？
What's so important that it can't wait?

52
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,650
真的对手机这么上瘾吗?
Are you really that addicted to the thing?

53
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,500
《赫芬顿邮报》(the Huffington Post)联合创始人安娜赫芬顿(Arianna Huffington)在采访中表示，
Co-founder of the Huffington Post, Arianna Huffington, has said in interviews

54
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,650
这种科技成瘾是一个重大问题，并且正在影响人们的心理健康。
that this tech addiction is a major issue and is affecting the mental health of people.

55
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,789
她说父母的情况同样糟糕，因此他们需要开始树立一个较好的榜样。
She said the parents are often as bad as the kids, so they need to start setting a better example.

56
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:35,123
她谈到科技产品给我们带来的多巴胺（传递兴奋），
She talks about the dopamine hits we get from technology,

57
00:03:35,123 --> 00:03:39,150
因此睡前浏览朋友圈不是一个好主意。
and so scrolling through Facebook right before bed is not a good idea.

58
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,689
当她睡觉的时候，房间里没有任何科技设备。
When she sleeps there is no technology in her room at all.

59
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:46,159
睡前看社交媒体也会让你感到压力。
You might also get stressed by looking at social media before bedtime.

60
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,900
你真的不想在你试图入睡前得到一个“羡慕他人”的机会。
You really don't want to get a shot of envy right before you try and fall asleep.

61
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,060
“哦，瞧，我的一个朋友在我负担不起的某个国家的海滩上”
“Oh, look, there's my friend on beach in some country I can't afford to go to.”

62
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,560
在尝试入睡之前，这并不是你想看到的。
This is not what you want in your head before you try and fall asleep.

63
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,659
以上，即是科技让你睡不着觉的原因。
So, technology, this is what's keeping you awake.

64
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,919
我们的建议很简单。
Our advice is simple.

65
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,729
睡觉前至少两个小时不要看任何电子屏幕。
Do not look at any electronic screens at least two hours before bed time.

66
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:09,969
你可能不太相信，但这会对你的睡眠周期产生负面影响。
You might not believe it, but it's negatively affecting your sleep cycle.

67
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,469
如果你是父母，请不要在孩子的卧室里使用高科技。
If you're a parent, don't allow tech in your kids' bedrooms.

68
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,098
如果你是个孩子，放聪明点，把那些设备关掉。
If you're a kid, wise up and turn that stuff off.

69
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:16,356
表现出一定的自制力...
Show some self-control...

70
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,956
如果我们开始听起来像是在给你们上课，
and if we are starting to sound like we are giving you a lecture,

71
00:04:18,956 --> 00:04:21,990
我们要说其实我们自己也才刚刚开始这么做。
we should say that we only just started doing this ourselves.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
并且可以告诉你，我们的睡眠质量变好了。
We can tell you that we started to sleep better.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,350
现在，假设你不使用电子产品，但仍然无法入睡。
Now let's say you don't use electronic gadgets but still can't sleep.

74
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:32,480
你没有感到沮丧或巨大压力，所以不知道问题出在哪里。
You are not depressed or particularly stressed and so don't know what the problem is.

75
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,949
你还没有坠入爱河，或者失去工作。
You haven't just fallen in love or lost a job.

76
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,769
你各方面很好，但睡觉对你来说很难。
You're fine, but sleeping is hard work for you.

77
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,556
你知道嘛，这有可能是因为你晚上喝的咖啡，或是喝的那些茶造成的。
You know, it could be those coffees you are having in the evening, or perhaps those cups of tea.

78
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,923
我们知道那些英国群众喜欢喝茶，他们中的很多人会在晚上来上一杯，
We know those British folks love their tea and quite a few of them will have a “cuppa”in the evening,

79
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:48,689
也许还会配上“晚餐”。
perhaps with their “supper”.

80
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:51,120
我们知道是因为我们亲眼目睹了。
We know this because we've seen it firsthand.

81
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,189
一杯上好的狄得利（tetley）红茶可能会让那些英国佬保持清醒。
That cup of the finest Tetley's tea could actually be keeping those Brits awake.

82
00:04:55,189 --> 00:05:00,219
晚上7点喝的星巴克的卡布奇诺可能会毁掉一个美国佬的睡眠。
That cappuccino from Starbucks the American had at 7 pm could ruin that person's sleep.

83
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,939
下面是咖啡因的实情。
This is the lowdown on the drug caffeine.

84
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,939
一旦被咖啡因冲击后将在30到60分钟后达到巅峰。
Once you've had your hit you'll peak around 30 to 60 minutes later.

85
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,810
然后兴奋将趋于平稳，但是咖啡因的半衰期为5到6个小时，
That buzz will then plateau, but caffeine has a half-life of five to six hours,

86
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,168
这意味着你的身体需要5到6个小时才能摆脱一半的咖啡因。
meaning this is the time it takes for your body to get rid of half of the drug.

87
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:18,079
在那之后的几个小时内，你的体内仍然会有一些咖啡因。
You'll still have some caffeine in your system for hours after that.

88
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,649
现在，正如你所知的，这并不是说咖啡因可以和冰毒之类的
Now, as you know, it's not as if caffeine can be compared to a substance such as ice,

89
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:25,079
非法物质相比，但它是一种兴奋剂。
the illegal kind, but it is a stimulant.

90
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,490
我们也会承认美国人喜欢这些东西，就像那些英国人喜欢他们的茶一样。
And we should say that Americans love the stuff, perhaps just as much as those Brits love their tea.

91
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,680
我们发现的一项研究称：“美国成年人每天平均摄入的咖啡因
One study we found said this, “The average daily consumption of caffeine by adults in

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,930
约为每人300毫克。
the U.S. is about 300 mg per person.

93
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,680
这大约是世界平均水平的三倍。
This is about three times higher than the world average.

94
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,589
但这仍然只是重度饮茶国家的咖啡因消费量的一半
But it is still only half of the caffeine consumption in heavy tea-drinking countries

95
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:46,299
就比如英国和瑞典。”
such as England and Sweden.”

96
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,490
有些人太喜欢喝咖啡了，
Some people like coffee too much,

97
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,339
虽然一杯意式浓缩咖啡有很多积极的影响，但仍然可能会使用超标。
and while there are many positive effects to having that shot of espresso, you can go overboard.

98
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,399
不管你信不信，在极端情况下，有人死于过量摄入咖啡因。
In extreme cases, believe it or not, people have died from overdosing on caffeine.

99
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,079
在不太极端的情况下，人则会感觉有点神经质。
In less extreme cases people just feel wired.

100
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,879
早上来上一杯感觉可能还不错，但在夜间却可能成为一场噩梦。
That might not be so bad in the morning, but at nighttime it can be a nightmare.

101
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:08,930
你可以看看星巴克或其他咖啡店的含量介绍，看看一杯咖啡里含有多少咖啡因。
You can look at coffee charts from Starbucks or other outlets and see how much caffeine there is in one cup.

102
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:13,790
这取决于杯子的大小，在即时速溶咖啡中可能只有50毫克咖啡因，
It depends on the size of the cup, but your instant stuff might just have 50 mgs of caffeine in it

103
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,449
这并不会让你点燃一些电子音乐，然后开始跳舞。
which isn't going to make you fire up some techno music and start dancing.

104
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:23,379
但在许多咖啡店出售的咖啡中含有200毫克甚至400毫克的咖啡因。
But many outlets sell cups of coffee with 200 or even 400 mg of caffeine in the cup.

105
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:28,000
星巴克的黄金烘焙（Blonde Roast）咖啡中含有475毫克的巨量咖啡因。
The Starbucks Blonde Roast has a massive 475 mg of caffeine in it.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,579
有专家说，当你摄入500到600毫克的咖啡因时，就像服用了小剂量的安非他命。
Some experts say when you get a hit of 500 to 600 mg it's like a small dose of amphetamine.

107
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:38,039
饮茶的人会表现得好一点，因为一杯普通的茶可能只含有50毫克的咖啡因，
Tea drinkers will fare better as a regular cup might only contain 50 mg of caffeine,

108
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,823
但是考虑到有些人喝茶就像上瘾了一样，同样也可能会产生“喝茶高潮”。
but given some folks drink tea as if they were addicted to it, it's possible to get a tea high.

109
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:48,389
总之，你真的不应该在晚上摄入咖啡因。
The long and short of all this is you really shouldn't be consuming caffeine in the evening at all.

110
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,600
我们建议你在午后喝上最后一杯。
We suggest you have your last hit in the afternoon.

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,256
我们发现的一项研究告诉我们，
We found one study that told us

112
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:56,879
睡前6小时摄入咖啡因会使人们的睡眠时间减少1小时。
that having caffeine 6 hours before bedtime reduced people's sleep time by one hour.

113
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,728
能量饮料也含有咖啡因，所以你在派对上喝的10瓶红牛伏特加
Energy drinks also contain caffeine, and so those 10 vodka Red Bulls you had at the party

114
00:07:01,728 --> 00:07:06,189
不仅会让你表现得像个白痴，还可能会减少你的睡眠时间。
might not only just make you act like an idiot but will likely cut down your sleep time.

115
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:10,779
如果不是注明非咖啡因品种，那这罐可乐就会含有咖啡因，所以请记住
A can of Coke will have caffeine in it if it's not the non-caffeine variety, so remember

116
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,259
睡前喝些软饮料可能不是一件好事。
that some soft drinks before bed might not be a good thing.

117
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:18,649
美国食品药物管理局告诉我们，咖啡因在大多数情况下是种安全的物质，
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration tells us that caffeine is for the most part a safe substance,

118
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:23,159
但是也说你不应该在一天内摄入超过400毫克的咖啡因。
but it says you should probably not consume more than 400 mg a day.

119
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,649
现在的你成天喝着茶或者咖啡，就着可乐吃着中晚餐的时候，就很容易超标。
That's easy to do when your chugging tea and coffee all day and then having your Cokes for lunch and dinner.

120
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,599
那晚上吃东西有什么坏处吗？
What about eating late at night?

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,090
一些研究告诉我们，晚食者可能会体重增加，因为你在睡觉时基本不活动。
Some studies tell us that late eaters might gain weight because you're hardly active when you're sleeping.

122
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,323
宾夕法尼亚大学（University of Pennsylvania）在2017年进行的另一项研究称，
Another study conducted by the University of Pennsylvania in 2017 said

123
00:07:39,323 --> 00:07:42,668
深夜进食会增加人们患2型糖尿病的几率。
eating late at night gives people a higher chance of getting type 2 diabetes.

124
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:46,590
研究称，晚上进食会提高胆固醇水平，
The study said late eating can raise cholesterol levels and so give you

125
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,100
因此也更容易患心脏病。
a better chance of having a heart attack.

126
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,223
事实上，并没有多少关于晚吃让人快乐的信息，但很多人都这样做。
In fact, there isn't much happy information concerning eating late, but lots of people do it.

127
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:57,769
想象一下，某个孩子一边嚼着立体脆(Doritos)薯片，一边喝着可口可乐，
Imagine this, some kid munching on a bag of Doritos while drinking a Coke and

128
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:01,698
一边在睡觉之前浏览着让人“嫉妒”的朋友圈动态。
scrolling through envy-inducing Facebook right before that kid wants to sleep.

129
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,810
这就好比有人去夜总会冥想
That makes about as much sense as someone going to a nightclub to meditate

130
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,680
或者去射击场准备微积分考试一样不符合逻辑。
or heading to the shooting range to study for their calculus exam.

131
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,788
根本没有任何意义，但是人们做到了。
It makes no sense at all, but people do it.

132
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:15,823
我们认为你们中的一些人现在正在做类似的事情，但你们可以稍后再承认。
We imagine a few of you are doing something like that right now, but you can admit to that later.

133
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,979
晚上让你的消化系统休息一下。
At nighttime give your digestive system a break.

134
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,590
有证据表明，饱腹的食物不仅对你的健康有害，
There is evidence that it's not only bad for your health,

135
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,430
而且也会影响你的睡眠质量。
but food in you full stomach can affect how much quality sleep you get.

136
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:27,310
如果你看了我们的另一个睡眠节目，你就会知道好的睡眠是
If you watched our other sleep show you'll know that the good kind of sleep is

137
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,139
当你进入到深睡眠，这被称为快速眼动周期。
when you go into deep sleep, and these are called rapid eye movement cycles.

138
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,639
一个晚上，你应该有大约5个这样的周期。
You should be getting about five of these a night.

139
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,288
另一种睡眠称为非快速眼动。
The other sleep is called non rapid eye movement.

140
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:40,223
研究表明睡前吃东西可以减少深睡眠周期，
Studies have shown that food before bed can reduce these deep sleep cycles

141
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:43,856
妨碍你去做那些对心理健康很重要的梦。
and prevent you from having those dreams that are so important to your mental well-being.

142
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,223
糖、碳水化合物和脂肪是晚上最不该吃的东西，
Sugar, carbs and fats are the worst things to eat late,

143
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:52,009
但也许我们会原谅你吃了一小口香蕉。
so perhaps we'll forgive you for having one small bit of banana.

144
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:55,956
这是我们发现的一篇文章的结论，“在睡觉时间吃东西，
This is the conclusion of one article we found, “Eating during bedtime hours,

145
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:59,556
无论是顿大餐还是在看你最喜欢的节目时吃的一点零食，
whether it's a large dinner or a small snack while watching your favorite TV show,

146
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:04,830
虽然看起来有助于入睡，但实际上可能会损害你的整体健康和新陈代谢，
while it may seem to help you fall asleep, may actually harm your overall health and metabolism,

147
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,750
在体内造成额外的压力。”
creating added stress inside the body.”

148
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,870
所以，这就是全部了。
So, there you go.

149
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,659
如果你身体健康，没有身体或精神疾病，
If you are healthy and not suffering from some physical or mental disease

150
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:13,588
这就可能是你睡眠不好的原因。
this might be the reason you are not sleeping well.

151
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,360
可遵循的建议也非常简单。
It's really simple advice to follow.

152
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,830
睡前两个小时关掉你的电子设备。
Just turn off your gadgets two hours before bed.

153
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,370
睡前至少六个小时不要摄入咖啡因，睡前也不要进食。
Don't consume caffeine at least six hours before bed and don't eat before you sleep.

154
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,623
如果你真的在半夜看这个节目，并且嘴里塞满了巧克力
If indeed you are watching this show at midnight with your mouth full of chocolate being cement-mixed

155
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:30,159
和可口可乐，那你基本上是在制造一场完美的糟糕睡眠。
with Coca-Cola you are basically creating a perfect storm of bad sleep.

156
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,789
还是说你不同意这些观点？
Or do you disagree?

157
00:09:31,789 --> 00:09:33,409
