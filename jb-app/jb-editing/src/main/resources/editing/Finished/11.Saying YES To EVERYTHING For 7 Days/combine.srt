1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,399
在2008年金凯瑞的电影《好好先生》中，金扮演了一个生活毫无出路的废柴，
In the 2008 Jim Carrey movie, Yes Man, Jim plays a man whose life is at a dead end,

2
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:10,899
因此他参加了个人发展计划（真人秀），加入的唯一前提就是：对事情说“好”。
and so he enrolls in a personal development course with a single premise: say yes to things.

3
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:15,032
无可避免的，他竟很好的断章取义，单纯的对他遇到的
Inevitably he takes it well out of context and simply decides to say yes to every single

4
00:00:15,032 --> 00:00:17,399
每一个机遇和问题都说“好”，
opportunity and question that comes his way,

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,999
引导他走向个人转变，拥有一个惊喜的浪漫和充实的生活。
leading him to a personal transformation, a surprise romance, and a fulfilling life.

6
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:27,199
在【事图秀】的工作有时真的很无聊。我是说，我们做了一些很勤勉的研究，
We here at The Infographics got really bored。I mean, we did some diligent research and

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,699
想知道说“好”的力量是如何转化的，
wanted to find out just how transforming the power of Yes really was,

8
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,665
所以我们再一次让观众备受喜爱的实验小白鼠重出囚笼，并给他一个任务：
so once more we let your favorite lab rat out of his cage and tasked him with one job:

9
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:37,899
一周时间，对任何事情都说“好”.
say yes to everything for an entire week.

10
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:42,599
第1天：我猜猜，一定是【事图秀】的某个领导怀旧了21世纪，
Day 1: So I'm guessing that somebody over at Infographics got nostalgic for the 2000s

11
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,932
看了电影《好好先生》，然后决定，
and watched Yes Man, then decided,

12
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:48,699
“嘿，在现实世界里强迫某个人这么做一定很酷”，然后我就来了。
“Hey that'd be cool to force somebody to do in the real world”, and here I am.

13
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:53,299
我在挑战前看了这部电影，这里有个事实，电影是基于剧本的，
I watched the movie before this challenge started, and here's the thing, the movie is based on a script,

14
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:56,499
编剧在剧本可以塑造故事，让金凯瑞对一切
where the writers can shape the story to make the consequences of Jim

15
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,099
说“好”的结果是他们想要的。
Carrey's saying yes to everything be whatever they want it to be.

16
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:03,799
影片最后金凯瑞开始了全新的生活，与美丽的佐伊（Zooey Deschanel）存在着
Jim Carrey ends up with a brand new life and a wonderful relationship with the beautiful

17
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:08,999
一段完美的关系，然而在现实世界对一切说“好”，
Zooey Deschanel, in the real world me saying yes to everything could very well

18
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:11,999
到最后我可能会变成一个帮墨西哥黑帮运毒的骡子。
end up with me becoming a drug mule for the Mexican Mafia.

19
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:16,899
不确定性强于任何挑战，这是唯一我觉得有真正的威胁让我陷入严重的麻烦，
Morseso than any challenge, this one I feel has the real potential to get me in serious trouble,

20
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:19,799
愚蠢的我当然，要去做了。
and stupid me is of course, going to do it.

21
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,199
规则很简单：对遇到的每一个机会和每一个提议都说“好”。
Rules are simple: say yes to every opportunity and every offer that comes my way.

22
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:30,099
像一个积极向上的禅师一样生活一周，不抵触世间天地万物
Live my life like a positive, life-affirming zen master for a whole week, and say yes to the universe.

23
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:33,799
以下是我生活、苦笑，友爱的一周，就像一个25岁左右的大学毕业生
This is my week to Live, Laugh, Love, like a mid-twenties college grad going through

24
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,299
经历她的第一次多重存在主义危机。
her first of multiple existential crisis.

25
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,999
顺便提一句，我刚意识到有了这个挑战，我将正式完成
By the way, I just realized that with this challenge I'll officially have lived out the

26
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,799
两部金凯瑞电影的情节。你能猜出另一部吗？
plot of two Jim Carrey movies. can you guess which one is the other?

27
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,199
第3天：前七十二个小时下来，一切都一团糟。
Day 3: First seventy two hours down, and what a mess things have been.

28
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,699
我没有告诉女朋友这个挑战，因为没有人比她更能承担
I didn't tell the girlfriend about the challenge, because there is no one who could handle the

29
00:01:52,699 --> 00:01:56,799
我只能说“好”的后果。
responsibility of me being able to say only yes worse than her.

30
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,199
我甚至不想去想，如果她知道我对她的每一个愿望和欲望只能说“好”的话，
I don't even want to think what kind of terrible, ridiculous things she would rope me into doing

31
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:04,699
她会逼迫我做出什么可怕、荒谬的事情。
if she knew I could only say yes to her every wish and desire.

32
00:02:04,699 --> 00:02:08,999
举个例子，她一直想和一对夫妇参加一个神秘谋杀晚宴，
For example, she's been wanting to do this murder mystery dinner party thing with another couple,

33
00:02:08,999 --> 00:02:11,999
而这对夫妇是非常糟糕的。
and these two are the absolute worst.

34
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:16,199
他们浮夸到了极点，任何时间对任何事物都有极强的控制欲，
They are both over dramatic to the extreme and have to be in charge of everything all the time

35
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:19,199
说句实话，我都不知道女友是怎么和他们做成朋友的，
honestly, I have no idea why she's friends with them,

36
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:22,499
但和他们在一起的一晚就如同是钳子拔牙。
but an evening with themis like pulling your teeth out with a pair of pliers.

37
00:02:22,499 --> 00:02:26,699
对了，他们还喜欢一有机会就进行极端的PDA活动。
Oh, and they love to engage in extreme PDA at the drop of a hat.

38
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,799
不了，谢谢您了。我告诉女友我不介意参加神秘谋杀晚宴，
No thank you, I told her that I don't mind doing murder mystery dinner party,

39
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:36,099
但绝对不和他们一起，并且基本每隔一周我就要拒绝一次。
but absolutely not with them, and have been refusing an invitation just about every other week.

40
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,099
不存在的！
NOT HAPPENING.

41
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:40,899
然后，我的第一天相对安然无恙，至少在女友回家之前。
So, my first day was relatively uneventful, at least until the girlfriend got home.

42
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,299
他们刚在我们这条街上建了一个全新的蔬菜烧烤店，
They just built a brand new Veggie Grill down the street from us,

43
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:48,899
对不了解的人说，就是一家素食餐厅，他们只供应蔬菜。
and for those of you who don't know, it's a vegetarian restaurant where they serve only vegetables.

44
00:02:48,899 --> 00:02:52,399
自从施工以来，女友就一直关注着这家餐厅，每次被她提起，
She's been eyeballing it ever since they started construction and every time she brought it up

45
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:58,399
我都设法转移话题，但这次她又问了一次，我尽职地说，“好的”
I managed to sidestep the conversation, but this time she asked again and I dutifully

46
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:02,799
我发誓刚说出这句话的时候身体抽搐了一下，她只是坐在那里，
I swear I physically winced as the words left my mouth and she just kind of sat there

47
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:05,699
然后说，“哇，真的嘛，这么简单？”。
for a moment and said, “Wow, really, just like that?”

48
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,199
我内心一边万马奔腾，一边点点头，然后我们就去了蔬菜烧烤店。
And I silently nodded while screaming inside, and off to Veggie Grill we went.

49
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,599
老实说，还没那么糟，假鸡块吃起来还不错，
Honestly, it's not that bad, their fake chicken nuggets even tasted kind of alright, but it's

50
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,599
但就是这样...没有吃到真实的肉让人难过的心碎。
always just so... heartbreakingly disappointing to not be eating the real thing.

51
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,499
让人感觉不到满足。
And it never fills me up.

52
00:03:21,499 --> 00:03:23,799
好吧，第二天开始有些奇怪。
Ok, so day two was a little weird.

53
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:27,399
这次我们一起去了杂货店，她建议我们买一些
This time we went to the grocery store together and she suggested we pick up several things

54
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:29,299
让我畏缩的东西。
that made me cringe hard.

55
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,199
一些带有“全有机”和“益生菌”标签的东西。
Things with labels like “all organic” and “pro-biotic”.

56
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:37,299
她说，“这些杏子、菠菜和纸板汁对健康很有益，
“This apricot, spinach and cardboard juice would be really healthy for you,

57
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,099
你应该拿上这些而不是些肥宅快乐水”。“好的，亲爱的” ，我尽职尽责的回答。
you should pick that up instead of some soda.”, she said, and “Yes, dear.” I dutifully replied.

58
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,599
“你为什么不试试这种藜麦的无可可豆、无糖巧克力，
“Why don't you try this quinoa based cocoa-free, sugar-free chocolate

59
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,899
用回收的有机鱼骨和和“悲剧”做成的，而不是那个奇巧巧克力棒？”
made out of recycled organic fish bones and sadness instead of that Kit Kat bar?”

60
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:50,899
“好的，当然”
“Yes, sure”

61
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:54,699
“我们应该得到一些健康的冰淇淋，而不是奥利奥饼干和奶油，
“We should get some of this healthy ice cream instead of that oreo cookies and cream.

62
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:57,999
它的成分有羽衣甘蓝，山羊奶，喜马拉雅海盐和‘抑郁’”
It's made out of kale, goat milk, himalayan sea salt and depression.”

63
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,899
“好的，听起来不错。”
“Yes, sounds great.”

64
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:03,899
就这样来来去去，现在的厨房里装满了带有各种意图的食品，
On and on it went, and now my kitchen is full of food that for all intents and purposes,

65
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,299
几乎全都不能吃。
is pretty much inedible.

66
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,499
别误会我的意思，我知道垃圾食品是，垃圾，但我和她之间
Don't get me wrong, I know junk food is, well, junk, but there has always existed a balance

67
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,599
总是有一种平衡，她在我们的饮食中占据了健康纯粹的一半，
between her and I, she gets to health nazi half of our diet, and I get to stay sane by

68
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,499
而我偶尔也会放纵另一半，以保持理智。
occasionally indulging the other half of the time.

69
00:04:16,499 --> 00:04:21,699
现在这种平衡被破坏了，而我下个星期将享受“零餐”。
Now that balance is destroyed, and I'm going to enjoy exactly zero of my meals for the next week.

70
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:22,799
谢谢你全家，【事图秀】。
Thanks, Infographics.

71
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,699
然而，这并不是那天最奇怪的事情。
That however wasn't the weirdness of the day.

72
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,199
奇怪发生在结账的时候。
The weirdness would come at checkout time.

73
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,199
在购物时，我总是会随身带一两个可重复使用的袋子，这比较环保，
I always take a reusable bag or two with me when we go shopping, it's environmentally friendly

74
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,599
在加利福尼亚，超市还对塑料袋收费，想要阻止人们
and in California they also charge for plastic bags in an attempt to deter you

75
00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:39,199
使用塑料袋并将其扔掉，因为它们最终有可能落入大海并杀死海龟。
from using them and throwing them away so they end up in the ocean and murder sea turtles.

76
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,599
所以我随身带了两个可重复使用的袋子，明显的我已经准备好把我们的
So I had the two reusable bags with me, and I very clearly was ready to put our groceries

77
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:47,999
杂物放进环保袋了，但当收银台的女孩问我，“你需要塑料袋吗？”。
inside of them, when the checkout girl asked me, “Would you like plastic bags for these?”.

78
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:53,099
我立刻就答应了，因为你知道，我是一个白痴，选择了这个作为职业，
I immediately said yes, because you know, I'm an idiot who chose this as a career, and

79
00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:57,199
然后我不得不沙雕地拿着我的塑料袋兜着的杂货，
then had to very stupidly take my plastic-bagged groceries while holding

80
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,499
同时拿着我那环保袋。
my reusable bags in my hand.

81
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,599
事情发生时女朋友没有注意，但当她转过身来时，
The girlfriend wasn't paying attention when it happened, but when she turned around

82
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:05,899
她给了我一个非常严厉的“wtf”表情，我只是耸耸肩，
she gave me a very stern 'wtf' look, and I just shrugged my shoulders

83
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:08,199
说也许我们可以用它们来当作垃圾袋。
and said maybe we can use them for trash bags.

84
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,099
然后我们走出了商店，如果她之前没有怀疑哪点出错了，
Then we walked out of the store, and if she didn't suspect something was up before, she

85
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:13,199
她现在肯定有。
definitely did now.

86
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,299
不出所料，我们一走出商店，就被一个拿着写字板的人拦住了。
Predictably as soon as we walked out of the store we got stopped by a guy with a clipboard.

87
00:05:17,299 --> 00:05:18,299
你知道的那种类型。
you know the type.

88
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:21,899
我通常会躲开这些请愿者，就像一个美国橄榄球联盟（NFL）在他赢得比赛
I typically outmaneuver these petitioners like an NFL running back on his way to scoring

89
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:25,032
触地得分的途中来回跑一样，但这家伙很不人道，
a game-winning touchdown, but this guy was inhuman,

90
00:05:25,032 --> 00:05:28,199
他将自己传送到了我们身前，没有人能避开他。
he practically teleported in front of us and there was no avoiding him.

91
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,499
他想要我们签字，以示我们对联邦政府强迫加州
He wanted us to sign to show our support against the federal government forcing California

92
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,799
降低汽车油耗标准的反对。
to lower its gas mileage standards for vehicles.

93
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,499
尽职尽责，我答应了。
Dutifully, I said yes.

94
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:38,699
女友此时眯起了眼，
The girlfriend's eyes narrowed at this point,

95
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,499
她知道我特意对任何有实质原因的活动都不表示公开支持，
she knows I go out of my way to not show public support for any specific causes,

96
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,099
而倾向于私底下的支持。
preferring to keep my support private.

97
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:50,599
我不喜欢群体，我也不喜欢在公开场合把自己和任何特定群体在意识形态排成一列。
I don't like groups, and I don't like lining myself up ideologically in public with any specific groups.

98
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,299
这样很容易陷入非自己本身的价值观，
it's too easy to get caught up in values that aren't your own,

99
00:05:53,499 --> 00:05:59,399
或让群体展示你不同意的价值观，但现在突然所有人都认为你认同 。
or to have the group show values that you disagree with but now suddenly everyone thinks you identify with.

100
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,799
你只是无法控制一个团体的走向，或者他们带给你的标签。
You just can't control a group, or how they'll make you look.

101
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,099
不，谢谢。
No thank you.

102
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,699
哪里出事了，她无疑对自己想。
Something was up, she no doubt thought to herself.

103
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,132
然而，那个请愿人又丢下一颗重磅炸弹，老实说，
Then though, the petitioner dropped a bomb, and I honestly think

104
00:06:09,132 --> 00:06:12,699
我现在就想变成一千个太阳灼烧掉这个男人。
I hate this man now with all the fury of a thousand suns.

105
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:15,999
“你想在几天内和我们一起在市中心举行抗议活动吗？”
“Would you like to join us in a protest downtown in a few days?”

106
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:22,899
是的，我绝对希望100％做到这一点，我咬紧牙关紧绷。
WHY YES I'D LOVE TO ABSOLUTELY 100% DO EXACTLY THAT -I growled through clenched teeth.

107
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,499
他不知道自己刚刚离死亡有多远，也不知道此刻我内心燃烧着
Unaware of how close to death this man had just come, or of the fiery furnace of wrath

108
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:31,432
熊熊怒火，他兴奋地记下了我的电话号码，
burning inside me at the moment, he excitedly took my phone number down

109
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,499
以便他们的协调员在周末晚些时候给我打电话并告诉我详细安排。
so their coordinator could call me with details later in the week.

110
00:06:34,499 --> 00:06:40,699
瞧，我现在成为了一个团体的一员，在休假的日子里公开抗议。
And voila, just like that I'd now be protesting in public on one of my days off, as part of a group.

111
00:06:40,699 --> 00:06:42,399
一群狂热粉。
Fan-freaking-tastic.

112
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,999
当我们到了车上，女朋友笑得合不拢嘴。
When we got to the car, the girlfriend grinned from ear to ear.

113
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,799
“你不能说不”，她说，一个逐渐变态的微笑洋溢在她的脸上。
“You can't say no”, she said, a very disturbingly conniving smile spreading across her face.

114
00:06:50,799 --> 00:06:55,999
我解释道，准确的说，在余下的五天我不得不继续对所有事情说“好”就对了，
I explained that it would be more accurate to say that I had to say yes to everything for another five days,

115
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,032
我发誓，当她毫无疑问地策划了上千个计划和阴谋时，我看到了她眼中的恶魔，
and I swear I saw the devil in her eyes as she no doubt hatched a thousand schemes and plots,

116
00:07:02,032 --> 00:07:05,799
她简直兴奋得头晕目眩，现在能让我做些什么呢！
practically giddy with excitement over what she could get me to do now.

117
00:07:05,799 --> 00:07:07,099
第7天：
Day 7:

118
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:08,099
完成。
Ok.

119
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:09,299
挑战结束。
Challenge over.

120
00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:11,399
再也不想再来一次了。
Never repeating again.

121
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,399
在《好好先生》中，金凯瑞仅靠说“好”就遇到了转折，获得了心上人。
In Yes Man, Jim Carrey had his life turned around and got the girl all by saying yes to life.

122
00:07:16,799 --> 00:07:20,799
在我的现实生活，我被勒索到女朋友能从我身上得到
In my real life I've been blackmailed into every possible concession the girlfriend could

123
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,899
的每一个可能的让步，并且再一次，公开地羞辱了我。
get out of me and was once more, very publicly humiliated.

124
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:25,599
让我们回到开头。
Let me start at the beginning.

125
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,699
没过多久，女朋友就开始滥用她的权力，
It didn't take long for the girlfriend to start abusing her power to make me say yes

126
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,799
让我对一切都说是。
to everything.

127
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:31,499
背部按摩？
Back rub?

128
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:32,199
好的。
Yes.

129
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,932
脚部按摩？
Foot rub?

130
00:07:32,932 --> 00:07:33,499
好的。
Yes.

131
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:34,299
来一杯冰水？
Fetch a glass of ice water?

132
00:07:34,299 --> 00:07:35,299
马上！！
Yes.

133
00:07:35,299 --> 00:07:36,832
我累了，你能再次遛下狗吗？
I'm tired, can you take the dog out again?

134
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:37,832
可以。
Yes.

135
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:42,399
可以预见，我基本上成为了一个奴隶，尽管值得赞扬的是，她在第一天仅使用这种方式滥用了它，
Predictably, I basically became a slave. although to her credit she only abused it in this fashion

136
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,599
我想我不能太责怪她。
for the first day, and I suppose I can't blame her too much for it.

137
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:49,799
我的意思是，想象一下，你可以让某人为你做一个星期的突发奇想，
I mean imagine you could get someone to do your whim for a whole week,

138
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:51,999
如果我对她的克制印象深刻的话。
if anything I'm impressed by her restraint.

139
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:56,599
然而，她不可避免的想起现在可以让我参加每个社交活动，
However, she inevitably remembered that she could now get me to go to every social engagement

140
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,399
那些我每次都死去活来不愿意去的活动，那么猜猜这周谁要去宝宝送礼会，
I have fought her tooth and nail on since forever, so guess who got to go to a baby

141
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,199
然后去为她一个朋友的8岁儿子开生日派对？
shower and then a birthday party for the 8 year old son of one of her friends this week?

142
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,299
真的不是孩子的粉。
I don't really do children.

143
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:11,599
直到最近，我才意识到有一天我们会有一个属于自己的孩子，
It's only been recently that I've warmed up to the idea of having one of our own one day,

144
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,699
老实说，在内心深处，我喜欢和她生孩子的想法。
and to be honest deep down inside I love the thought of having a child with her.

145
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:18,799
但是其他人的孩子...哦，算了吧。
But other people's kids... oh god no.

146
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:19,799
什么都行，除了孩子。
Anything but that.

147
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,299
我在孩子傍边感觉即奇怪又尴尬。
I'm weird and awkward around children.

148
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,999
我曾不得不给三个不同的朋友发短信，问他们你是如何向
I once had to text three different friends asking them how do you introduce yourself

149
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:28,599
一个十岁的孩子介绍自己的。 你是不是，和他们们碰碰拳头或者什么的？
to a ten year old. do you just like, give them a handshake or something?

150
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:32,399
所以我不得不坐在一个一堆大吼大叫的孩子们的生日派对上，
So I got to sit through a birthday party full of screaming children

151
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,899
完全不知道如何与他们恰当地互动。
whom I had no idea how to properly interact with.

152
00:08:34,899 --> 00:08:39,499
真的我对孩子一无所知，就像他们在八岁的时候就知道如何分辨面孔了吗？
Like I know nothing about children, do they even know how to tell faces apart yet at eight years old?

153
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:44,499
然后是宝宝送礼会，我不得不和另外两个被胁迫的丈夫/男朋友
Then there was the baby shower, where I had to sit quietly with the two other husbands/boyfriends

154
00:08:44,499 --> 00:08:49,799
安静地坐在一起，而女人们则在各种与婴儿有关的礼物上“啧啧”和“啊哈”。
who got roped into going while the women all 'oohed' and 'aahed' at various baby-related gifts.

155
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,732
我甚至不知道我们该带什么礼物，我建议买个搅拌机，
I didn't even know what gift we should bring, I suggested a blender

156
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:57,799
因为我完全不清楚婴儿食品是怎么进行的，女朋友则是摇摇头，
because I'm not entirely sure how baby food works, and the girlfriend just shook her head

157
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:59,499
然后拖着我去熊宝宝商店。
and dragged me shopping for Baby Bjorns.

158
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:05,199
不过，本周的真正大奖是，我知道，就是知道，这事会发生，
The real prize of the week though, and I knew, just knew, that this would happen, which is

159
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:08,699
这也是为什么我一开始没有告诉女朋友这个挑战…
why I didn't tell the girlfriend about the challenge in the first place...

160
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:10,599
我打赌你们大多数人都能猜到。
I bet most of you can guess.

161
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:17,299
是的，与“过于戏精-超级专横-过度亲热-不合时宜”夫妇一起参与神秘谋杀晚宴，
Yep, murder mystery dinner with Mr. and Mrs. overly-dramatic-super-bossy-very-publicly-inappropriate-PDA.

162
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:22,932
噢，那是一个时代主题晚宴，所以我们必须穿服装并扮演角色。
Oh and it was period themed so of course we had to wear costumes and act the part.

163
00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:26,399
戏精夫妇喜欢的类型。
Which Mr. and Mrs. overly-dramatic absolutely loved.

164
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:30,599
规则是这样的：我们随机从帽子里抽取角色，
So the way it worked was like this: we showed up, randomly pulled roles out of a hat, and

165
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:33,499
然后穿上符合我们这个时期的角色的服装。
then got dressed in our period appropriate costumes.

166
00:09:33,499 --> 00:09:37,199
我抽到到了一个军官的角色，这让我有点略微吃惊，
I got the role of an army officer, which was kind of on-the-nose to be honest,

167
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,699
但女友得到了情妇的角色，当她大声朗读出自己的角色时，我不禁大笑起来。
but the girlfriend got the role of mistress, and I could not stop laughing when she read it aloud.

168
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:46,199
我开始在晚上称呼她为“荡妇”，为此她每次都会捶我，
I proceeded to call her 'wench' for the evening and my arms are bruised badly from all the

169
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,699
所以我的手臂变得青肿。你们有些人知道的，她经常练拳击，
times she punched me for calling her wench. as some of you know, she boxes regularly,

170
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,499
“荡妇”是一个她讨厌的刺戳。
so she's got a nasty jab.

171
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:58,132
戏精夫抽到了警察局长，戏精妇抽到了有抱负的新星。
Mr. and Mrs. overly-dramatic though, well he pulled police chief, and she got aspiring starlet.

172
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:01,399
我已有预感今晚将是人类历史上最痛苦、
Already I could tell the evening was going to be the single most painful, unbearable

173
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,299
最难以忍受的一次体验。
experience in human history.

174
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,499
所以你应该在他们给你上不同菜的时候好好地坐下来，
So you're supposed to sit for dinner while they serve you different courses, and right

175
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:11,999
然后从晚宴开始后戏精夫妇将会忽视你，
from the get-go Mr. and Mrs. Drama would steadfastly refuse to acknowledge you

176
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,799
除非你用他们虚构的人物名来称呼他们。
unless you addressed them by their fictional character names.

177
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:17,632
对了，他们还要求我们围着桌子，
Oh, and they demanded we go around the table

178
00:10:17,632 --> 00:10:21,199
为自己的角色编造背景故事并进行自我介绍。
and make up backstories for our character and introduce ourselves.

179
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:27,265
并且他们也会不断对每个人的故事背景提出有用的、非常有力的“建议”，
Except they would insist on making helpful and very forceful 'suggestions' to every single person's backstory,

180
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:29,299
你知道，一些小提示可以增强“沉浸感”。
you know, little notes to enhance the 'immersion'.

181
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:32,999
我真的认为我磨牙打碎了一颗臼齿。
I honestly think I shattered a molar from grinding my teeth.

182
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,732
到了晚上才十分钟，他们已经想试图控制每个人的体验。
It was barely ten minutes into the evening and already they were trying to control everybody's experience.

183
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:41,832
关于这种古老谋杀神秘事件，有一条不成文的规定，
There's an unwritten rule about these old-timey murder mystery dinner events

184
00:10:41,832 --> 00:10:45,399
每个人都会因为某种原因而带上英国口音。
where everyone for some reason puts on a british accent.

185
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,899
因为每次出现神秘谋杀案的时候，那就和英国人有关。
the moment you think murder mystery, everyone thinks british.

186
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:48,999
真的很奇怪。
It's really weird.

187
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:53,999
所以很自然地，我就用我能应付的最难听的澳大利亚口音解释说
So naturally I put on the most awful australian accent I could manage, explained that I was

188
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:57,365
我是一名来自“下乌达”的军官，并称所有人为“伙计”，
an officer from 'down undah', and called everyone mate.

189
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,365
除了我所谓的“荡妇”女友，
except the girlfriend whom I referred to exclusively as wench,

190
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:03,599
作为回报每次她都会打我一下。
receiving a swift punch in the arm in return every time.

191
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:08,499
长话短说，在第一个菜进行到一半时，
To make a very painful and long story short, halfway through the first course the lights

192
00:11:08,499 --> 00:11:13,299
灯光熄灭一切进入黑暗，出现了一声假枪声，有人开始尖叫，
go out and everything is pitch black, there's a fake gunshot and someone screams,

193
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,499
当灯光再次亮起，庄园的主人则死于枪伤。
and when the lights come back up the lord of the manor is dead from a gunshot wound.

194
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:21,499
然后，你需要找出凶手是谁，因为当你绘制角色时，
Then you're supposed to figure out who did it because secretly when you drew for characters,

195
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:24,299
纸条上写者你是否是杀人犯。
your slip says if you were the murderer or not.

196
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:25,999
还有一把要藏起来的道具枪
And you get a prop gun to hide.

197
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:30,299
我敢肯定，对于其他任何一组玩家来说，这都可能是一场爆炸，
I'm sure with any other group of people, it could've been a blast, but right from the

198
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:36,699
但从一开始就是戏精夫妇负责安排场景，当然他们安排了，他毕竟抽中了警察局长的身份。
start Mr. and Mrs. drama took charge, and of course they did, he did pull chief of police after all.

199
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:41,099
然后，我们花了大约一个小时的时间和这两个戏精来回盘问人们的背景，
Then we spent about an hour with those two going back and forth grilling people's backstories

200
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:45,499
并且在我们面前有意无意的勾勾搭搭，
and randomly making out with each other for no reason in front of us,

201
00:11:45,499 --> 00:11:46,899
所有的这些时候，我都只管吃我的食物。
all while I tried to just eat my food.

202
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:51,699
好不容易到的上甜点的时刻，说真的，这种时候服务太拖沓了，
After struggling to make it to dessert, seriously, they serve you so damn slowly at these things.

203
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,599
我终于宣布，既然庄园主以前是海军军官
I finally announced that since the lord of the manor had previously been an officer in the navy,

204
00:11:55,599 --> 00:12:00,399
而我作为英国皇家海军唯一的军官，正式宣布
and as the only officer from Her Majesty's royal navy, I was officially declaring

205
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,499
这项调查事关国家安全，然后指责那个“荡妇”，
the investigation a matter of national security, and then blamed the wench,

206
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:07,199
【又打我一下】，指控她谋杀。
who punched me for calling her that, and charged her with murder.

207
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,399
她抗议，其他人也抗议，我告诉他们，
She protested, as did the rest of the room, and I told them that this was 19th century

208
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,699
这是19世纪的英国， 显然作为一名军官，我可以没有任何证据的责怪任何非贵族的人,
Britain, apparently, and as a military officer I could literally blame anyone who wasn't

209
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:18,699
并且也没有人敢出来质疑我。
noble with no evidence and nobody would dare question me.

210
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,099
然后我说我需要带走那个“荡妇”，【再次打我】，来一个非常私人和热切的搜索，
I then said I needed to take the wench, punched me again, for a very private and intense search

211
00:12:24,099 --> 00:12:28,299
去找到她身上的凶器，不管它藏在哪里。
to find the murder weapon on her person, no matter where it may be hidden

212
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:31,099
她再次打我一拳，这次是因为恶心。
to which she punched me again, this time for being gross.

213
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,799
事实证明，她确实是杀手。
Turns out though, she really was the killer.

214
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:37,799
当然，这需要花半个小时的来回与戏精夫妇
Of course it took a half hour of back and forth with Mr. and Mrs. Drama boss dictating

215
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,799
口述整件事，当然他们应该在第一时间就让我脱衣搜查我的女朋友.
the whole thing, when they should've just let me strip search my wench girlfriend in the first place.

216
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,299
如果这还不够我受的话，到第二天我就得去参加我承诺过的抗议活动。
If that wasn't enough, the next day I had to show up at the protest I had promised to attend.

217
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,999
你猜怎么着？组织者只邀请到六个人来参加，
And guess what? the organizers had only gotten like half a dozen people to show up, so I

218
00:12:51,999 --> 00:12:58,199
所以我只好在洛杉矶市中心举着牌子游行，另外五个人则随意的喊着口号。
got to march around downtown Los Angeles holding a sign up with five other people chanting random slogans.

219
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:00,699
在生活，尤其是对一段感情，
In life, and especially in a relationship,

220
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:04,899
有时对你不想做的事情妥协并答应是很重要的。
 it's important to compromise and say yes sometimes to things you don't want to do.

221
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:09,099
当你同意别人想做或喜欢做的事情时，会让别人感到高兴，
It makes other people happy when you agree to things they want to do or they like to

222
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:12,899
即使自己本身不喜欢，不想做，
do even if you don't like or want to do those things.

223
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:17,099
妥协基本上是快乐友谊或甜蜜关系的秘诀。
Compromise is basically the secret to a happy friendship, or a happy relationship.

224
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:21,299
本周，我做了足够多的妥协来维持我接下来几年的生活，
This week though, I did enough compromising to last me the next several years,

225
00:13:21,499 --> 00:13:25,899
如果再有人拿着请愿书在我离开商店时向我走来的话，
and if anyone comes up to me when I'm exiting the store with a petition in hand,

226
00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:28,599
我就是李小龙，直接削他们的脸，然后在他们反应过来之前跑掉。
I'm karate, chopping them in the face and running away before they can recover.

227
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,199
你能一周之内说“好”吗？
Think you could say only yes for a whole week?

228
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,699
你还想看到备受宠爱的小白鼠进行哪些挑战？
What other challenges do you want to see your favorite guinea pig undertake?

229
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:35,699
写在评论中让我们知道吧！
