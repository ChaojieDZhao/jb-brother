1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,002
嘿，这里是Mr.B，今天我们要买下
hey! MrBeast's here. Today we're gonna buy

2
00:00:02,152 --> 00:00:04,487
这家食品超市里的所有商品，开始吧
every item in this store, let's do it

3
00:00:06,406 --> 00:00:08,775
我觉得光凭你一人完成不了
I don't think you can do this all by yourself

4
00:00:09,075 --> 00:00:10,527
我觉得你应该闭嘴
I don't think you should speak anymore

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,328
我也觉得我该闭嘴了
I don't think I should either

6
00:00:12,328 --> 00:00:14,014
这个视频的要点基本上就是要
So you get the gist of the video, we're basically

7
00:00:14,147 --> 00:00:15,749
买下这家店里所有商品
buying literally everything in the store,

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,018
但如果只有克里斯（Chris），我，还有
which if it was just Chris, me, and

9
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:20,804
钱德勒（Chandler）估计会耗时一辈子，所以我带了一些朋友
Chandler would take forever, so I brought some friends

10
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,596
确保你拿了所有的商品，不要留下一丁点东西在货架！
Make sure you get everything, don't leave a single thing on the shelf!

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,136
看看这周围的人，我把
Look at all these people here, I just like

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,771
我通讯录名单都联系了一遍
literally went down my contact list

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,040
我说，嘿，能过来帮我搬空一座食品商店吗？
I was like, hey, you want to help me buy everything in the store?

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,358
然后令人惊喜的是每个人都说，没问题！
and surprisingly everyone was just like, sure!

15
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:45,145
放进去一些薄荷糖
Here's some mint thins

16
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:47,047
这里，我们来帮康纳（Conor Phillip）填满手推车
Here, let's, let's help Conor Phillip full his cart

17
00:00:48,448 --> 00:00:53,486
-你要一些萝卜罐头吗？ -好啊 -给你，玩的开心
-Here, you want some carrots? -Sure -There you go, have fine

18
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:55,939
老铁，这里有各式各样的果汁
Oh man, we got all kinds of juices over here

19
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,591
-让我来帮你 -谢了，吉米（唐纳森）！
-Let me help you -Thanks!! Jimmy (Donaldson)

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,332
好的，你的手推车已经满了，拿着这个信用卡去付款吧
Alright, your cart is full, take this credit card and go pay for it

21
00:01:06,332 --> 00:01:07,300
这些能给我吗？他们是我的最爱
These are my favorite, can I have them?

22
00:01:12,889 --> 00:01:16,743
可以，给你个手推车，你放进去啥我们都会给它买单
Yes, I got you a cart, whatever you put in there we will pay for

23
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,412
-好的 -玩的开心。给，来点腌黄瓜
-Ok! -Have fine. Here, grab some pickles

24
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,131
嘿，这是我第二次排队了
Hey, this is my second time in the line

25
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,855
大哥，你都拿了什么？
What did you get, sir？

26
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:30,723
所有我能自己拿的东西
Everything I can get my hands on

27
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,209
-给你卡，去结账吧 -爽歪歪
-Here you go, go checkout. okay, alright, here's a credit card -Awesome

28
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:34,878
你可能想知道为什么我们要买所有的这些东西？
You might be wondering why are we buying all this stuff?

29
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,479
我们买它是因为我们想把它捐给
What we're buying it because we

30
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,148
慈善机构，比如食物银行（赈济处），
want to give it to charity, like a food bank,

31
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:39,799
流浪庇护所，或一个随机的路人，
a homeless shelter, or if a random

32
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:41,534
他想吃豆子，我们就给他
guy on the street who wants beans, we'll just give it to him

33
00:01:41,534 --> 00:01:46,739
你知道他们为你做了一款豆子吗？ 《有钱有内涵》
Did you know that made beans about you? <thick and rich>

34
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:47,907
德斯汀（Destin），你都拿啥了？
Destin, what do you have right now?

35
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,026
-大玉米罐头 -所有的这些！有打火机吗？
-Big corn guy -All of this corn. Do you have a lighter?

36
00:01:50,226 --> 00:01:51,811
-打火机？ -恩
-A lighter? -Yeah

37
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,246
你要打火机干嘛？
Why are you need a lighter for?

38
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:55,682
给你做爆米花啊！
So you can make popcorn

39
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,518
德斯汀，我都看不到你了
I can't even see you anymore, Destin

40
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:05,558
是吗？
Oh, really?

41
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,027
所以还需要更多商品
So they need  more stuff and

42
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,746
还需要付款 -是真的顾客吗？
they needs to be paid for -There's  a real customer?

43
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,181
真实的顾客
A real customer

44
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:12,132
你不想买点其他的吗？
You don't want anything else?

45
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:13,266
你买吧，我们会付钱的
We will pay for it

46
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,317
我们要把整个超市都买完
We're gonna buy everything in the store. So..

47
00:02:14,517 --> 00:02:16,386
看到你想要的，只管拿就行
Anything you want, just grab it

48
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,856
芝士泡芙，走吧我们去找
We need cheese puffs, let's go find it

49
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,141
我们现在需要芝士泡芙！
We need some cheese puffs right now!

50
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,559
找到了，有人给她了
She got the cheese puffs, he gave her cheese puffs

51
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,177
-很好 -我们没事了
-Ok -We're good we're good

52
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:25,979
有人照顾好她了
She's taking care of

53
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,198
克里斯（Chris） 很擅长一件事，就是泡芙和猪油
There is one thing Chris is good for, it is cheese puffs and lard

54
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,750
-我拿了桶猪油。我很不高兴 -为啥？
-I got our tub of lard. I'm upset -Why?

55
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:34,287
有人在藏奇多，以备日后吃
He's hiding those Cheetos for later

56
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,834
这都不是我们的商店，但我们全面接手了
This isn't even our store, we have like a full-scale operation

57
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,336
这些人都是我的员工
All these people I'm paying to do this

58
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:54,524
-他在干什么？他哪找的那个车子？ -我木知啊
-What is he doing? Where did he get that? -I don't know

59
00:02:54,524 --> 00:02:56,809
我弄了一堆土豆，一罐豆子
I got a lot of potatos, one can of beans

60
00:02:58,061 --> 00:02:59,395
到目前我们花多少钱了？
How much have we spent so far?

61
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,187
才花了$800美元，伙计们你们都在干嘛？？？
We're only up to $800 guys!! What are you doing??

62
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,656
-来搬点卫生纸 -所有的？ -是的，好吧
-Let's do toilet paper -All of it? -Yes, well

63
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,710
这效率也太低，一个稍大点的卫生纸就填满了整个购物车
that was not efficient, one bigger toilet paper fill up the entire card

64
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,978
伯特（Bert），你想要宇宙布朗？
Bert oh, you want some cosmic brownies?

65
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,112
是的，都在找自己想吃的呗
Yeah, I'm doing my part

66
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:19,966
别再扔我吃的！每次都这样！！
Don't throw them again! every time!!

67
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,602
-你手推车还是空的 -不是空的，我有宇宙布朗尼
-Your car's empty -No, it's not, I got cosmic brownies

68
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:27,056
我能来点...反正都要全买了
Can I just like, I mean it's probably like buying everything

69
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,142
我要努力吃布朗尼蛋糕，要健康!!
I'm trying to be healthy to eating brownies

70
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,797
我们有难题了，
We are having a little bit of a dilemma,

71
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:36,716
我们已经填满了每辆购物车，现在怎么办？
we filled up every card. Now what?

72
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,402
你身后是什么玩意？
What is happening behind you?

73
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:40,386
发生了什么？
What is going on?

74
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:42,906
请让一让！
Excuse us!

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,391
我们不想妨碍你们
We don't want to interrupt this

76
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:47,844
给你一点，以防你突然也想吃一点
Here you go, just in case you want some

77
00:03:47,844 --> 00:03:48,728
谢谢小钱钱！
Thank you!

78
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,496
-那是什么鬼东西？ -我木知啊
-What was that? -I don't know

79
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,448
你们真的在吃麦片吗？就在我们做了
How are you, are you guys really eating cereal after the

80
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,234
上期视频之后
last video we did

81
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,485
是啊！
Yep!

82
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:09,632
上个视频里我们给了一个流浪庇护所价值$10万美元的物品
In the past we did a video where we gave $100,000 worth of stuff to a homeless shelter

83
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:12,101
但是比较杂乱，不容易拆开，
and it was really unorganized and hard to unpack and

84
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:13,820
也不容易存放，所以现在我们
hard to like put away for them. So now we're

85
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,738
把所有物品放在像这样的，类似糖果盒的盒子里，
putting everything in boxes, like this is a candy box,

86
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:16,789
因此对于食物银行更容易
so it's easier for the food bank

87
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:20,994
将所有补充物分类和存储起来
they would take all this supplies to to like sort it and store

88
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:29,836
朋友们，来点订阅，因为这可能花我一大笔钱
Can you guys subscribe! This is probably gonna cost me a lot of money

89
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,738
你看看他们打包了多少商品
I mean look at how much stuff they are arriving

90
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,410
我们就是随便把东西堆在手推车里，
Like we just literally been putting stuff in carts

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,062
我都不知道有什么。但是，
and I have no idea what it's been. But,

92
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,965
我知道我们有猪油，并且我很高兴
I do know that we've got some lard and I'm very happy about it

93
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:44,934
我们在买的时候他们也在运送更多的货物
They're delivering more food as we're buying it

94
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:45,918
我去，真的吗？
Wait, really?

95
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:47,036
来了一辆送货车
They poured the truck backed in

96
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,506
我们不需要了，别送了，走开.. 我们花了太多钱了
We don't need it, we don't need it! go away.. We're spending too much money

97
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,909
我需要观众姥爷们去ShopMrBeast买些衣裳
I need you guys to go shopMrBeast.com buy some merch

98
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:58,698
因为我没想到竟然还有送货？？快去买吧亲
Because I was not expecting another delivery, sooo yeah

99
00:05:03,653 --> 00:05:04,921
这个是我的锅
Alright, that was my fault

100
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,850
钱德勒，玩的还好吗？很好，也就只有这些了
Chandler，are you having fun? good, that's all you have it

101
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,835
小杰杰，我真为你骄傲！
Jerry, I'm proud of you!

102
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:20,703
花我的钱，这就是我想要的
Spending my money, this is what I want

103
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,138
-谢谢 -不足挂齿
-Thanks -You are welcome

104
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:24,607
这就是我想要的，空货架
This is what I want! Empty show

105
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,626
当我们说要买所有东西，就指我们需要所有东西
When we say we are buying everything, we need everything

106
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,077
除了一些香蕉
Except for maybe some bananas

107
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,480
我们将近花了$14278.01
We are up to fourteen thousand two hundred

108
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,732
$14279.03美元
and seventy-eight to seventy-nine

109
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:50,717
很好，这个收银台还阔以
Alright, this one is doing good

110
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,919
好，这个显示器有
and on this register left is six

111
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,188
$6261.70美元
thousand two hundred and sixty one dollars

112
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,640
到目前为止，我们花了大约$2万3千块
So far we spent about twenty-three thousand dollars

113
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,359
-我们的目标不是要花$10万美元吗？ -是的
-Aren't we supposed to spend like a hundred -Yeah

114
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:00,727
所以我们相当于完成了百分之23
So we're like twenty-three percent done

115
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,745
-差不多 -很好，待会见
-Basically -All right, I'll see you later

116
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,517
钱德勒讨厌腌黄瓜，所以唯一合理的事情就是
Chandler hates pickles, so the only logical thing

117
00:06:07,517 --> 00:06:11,020
来一辆装满腌黄瓜的手推车给钱德勒
to do is to fill this cart with pickles and give to him

118
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,089
-小钱钱去哪了？ -钱德勒？
-Where is chan chan? -Chandler?

119
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,290
-小钱钱跑哪去了？
-Where is chan Chandler?

120
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,643
中间来一段钱德勒拉屎的视频
Leave it to Chandler to be pooping in the middle of vedio

121
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,331
小钱钱，我们有一个惊喜要给你
Chandler, all right we got a surprise for you

122
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,072
大概一年前
Like, a year ago

123
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,224
-哦，好吧，知道就行 -耶，这条过道基本快要空了
-Oh, okay, good -Yeah we're almost done with this aisle

124
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:31,958
大概还有五个过道吧
We sort of like five more

125
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,725
没事
It's all right

126
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:36,295
-大概20％ -这太多了，太多了，好样的
-It's 20% -Yeah that's a lot that's a lot, good job

127
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,970
这里需要警示，我马上回来
I need cuidado, I'll be right back

128
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,907
安全第一！！
Safety first

129
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:55,581
我单纯觉得你们不能堆太高
I feel like you guys shouldn't be boxing in the employees

130
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,524
牛掰
Yes

131
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,976
我有番茄汁，我们有番茄酱
We got tomato sauce, we got tomato paste,

132
00:07:06,976 --> 00:07:08,177
我们有番茄丁
we got diced tomatoes

133
00:07:09,245 --> 00:07:10,129
哦，你叫它们西红柿
Oh, you call them tomatoes

134
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:11,731
好吧，我想我们不能一起出去浪了
well I guess we can't hang out then

135
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:22,458
天呐，看看这些手推车
Oh, my God. Look at all these carts

136
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,511
-世界末日的征兆, 什么鬼？ -我们买的比我想象要多
-Checking the apocalypse. What? -We bought more than I thought we bought

137
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:29,298
里面就像个正在全面开展的的军事行动
I mean this is like a full-scale military operation we got going on yet

138
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:30,867
好消息我们还要继续
Good thing that we have more

139
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,186
目前为止我们花了2万5千美元，那边那个
So far we spent twenty five thousand and on that one over there

140
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,120
我们花了8千
we've spent eight thousand

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,907
当'省太多'之城陷落时你们在哪里
Where were you guys when the siege of save-a-lot went down

142
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,643
为什么不来救援？
Why did you not come to the rescue?

143
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:56,759
为啥怼的是我？
Why me?

144
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,278
所以是的，我们从字面上扫空了整个个个个
So yeah, we literally cleared this entireeee

145
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:02,482
钱德勒，我们打算清扫整个过道
Chandler! We're trying to clear all the aisles

146
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,649
起来，别在上面睡觉！
Get, stop sleeping on them

147
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:07,770
我不能说我买光了所有的东西，但如果还有一个钱德勒要出售的话
I can't say I bought everything in the store if there's a Chandler for sale

148
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,340
好了
There we go

149
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,376
现在我们清理了整个货面
Now we've cleared all this roof

150
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:14,877
-给我拍拍背 -交给我了
-You wanna wipe my back -I got you

151
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:28,774
现在进展的越来越快，所以我们
So things were moving fast enough, so we

152
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,543
只能在大街上雇一些随机的路人
actually ended up just hiring random people off the street

153
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,045
到了现在这个点，我不知道我要给多少人薪水，
So at this point I don't even know how many people I'm paying for an hour

154
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:34,864
可能25个人
probably like 25

155
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:36,215
不清楚，但确实有很多人在工作
I don't know, but we have a lot of people working

156
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,434
嘿！你有什么发现？你弄了松饼？
Hey! What you got there? you got Twinkies?

157
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,019
好吧，听着，如果你不告诉别人的话
All right look, I'll give you

158
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,922
我分你一个
guys one if you don't tell anybody

159
00:08:52,748 --> 00:08:56,819
-这有必要吗？-超过$1万了，很好！！
-Was that necessary? -We are over ten grand? Perfect!

160
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:04,410
不客气怎么说？ 得哒塔，阿里嘎多！
How do I say you are welcome, de nada arigato

161
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,945
那是日本话
That's Japanese

生意突然爆裂！

169
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:42,031
看看我们买了多少东西？我们花了多少钱？
Look how much stuff we're buy? How much money have we spent ?

170
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:44,066
-我木知啊 -我应该知道的！
-I don't know -I should probably know！

171
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:46,319
去ShopMrBeast买点商品成为
shopMrBeast.com become an investor

172
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,989
慈善的投资人，我也可以多做点这样的事，并给我的摄像小哥发工资
by buying merch. I  can do stuff like this and pay my cameraman

173
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:52,408
他想要一个东西，想要问问你
He just wants one thing, he wants to ask you

174
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:53,876
不，不不，别就来一个啊，来一百多件，
Oh, no no no, don't buy one thing, but like a hundred things

175
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:56,512
-不管你买什么都会付钱的 -好吧
-Whatever you buy we will pay for -Okay

176
00:10:00,716 --> 00:10:02,685
你能行的

嘿，泰勒，我是说我们需要更多的番茄酱
Hey, Taylor, I mean we need to get more ketchup

我估计其他的就剩下在树上的了
I think they're at ketchup tree

181
00:10:39,322 --> 00:10:42,274
看呐，这说的是你，大号处男

兄弟，这看起来很美好，还需要很长时间

还是要花点时间看看
Still take a while

184
00:10:55,504 --> 00:10:57,390
看看你帮忙的下场？你弄掉所有东西
See what happens when you help? You drop everything

185
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,409
-好吧，因为盒子坏了 -是嘛
-Well the box was broken -Aha

186
00:11:02,478 --> 00:11:03,846
-好的，我们来漫步一下
-Alright, let's go for a little stroll

187
00:11:04,046 --> 00:11:06,282
如你所见，货架已空
As you can see, empty

188
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:10,469
-三号过道，如你所见，这是啥？克瑞斯 -啥都没有
-Aisle number three, as you can see, what is it? Chris -Empty

189
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,488

五号走道，也快空了
In Aisle numer five, almost empty

191
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,377
还剩下一点汽水饮料，还在处理中
Got a little bit of soda left we're still working on it

192
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,831
恩.. 这看上去真的很紧绷，跟个炸弹一样
This is uh, this is really tight, that's like a bomb

193
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,032
你能打开吗？
You want open it?

194
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,402
别他喵的指着我啊？你为啥指着我，吉米？
Don't! Why do you pointing at me? why do you pointing at me? Jimmy!

195
00:11:26,402 --> 00:11:30,189
小钱钱，我给你$100块要是你打开的话
Oh, Chandler, I will give you a hundred dollars if you open it

196
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,774
$100块

197
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,627
好，可以了，可以，小心摄像机
Alright! stop stop, the camera

199
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,348
注意！打扫一下5号走道
Attention! clean up on aisle 5

200
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:43,135
钱德勒洒了些汽水，沙雕行为，谢谢
Chandler spilled some soda, this is dumb, thank you

201
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:46,706
-你做的很好 -我能来个簸箕吗？
-U are doing a great job -Can I get a dustpan?

202
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:49,191
-你这样清理不对！ -咋了？
-That's not how you clean it up. Chandler -What?

203
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:51,494
-那是液体 -这是个扫帚，不是液体
-That's the liquid -This is a broom, not the liquid

204
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:52,712
大沙雕
Stupid

00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:55,247
-四个小时
-For four hours

206
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:55,998
四个小时！
Four hours!

207
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:58,434
五分钟，嘣蹦蹦
5 boo boo boom

208
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,629
我有点虚，害怕看到截至到现在花多少了，
I'm scared to see how much we spent. It's

209
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,415
差不多两个小时没看收银台了
been like two hours since I checked cash register

210
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,884
这些是最后一批不易腐烂的食物
These are the last non-perishable items

211
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:18,888
因为食品收纳所不喜欢有易腐烂的食物存储
because the food shelter don't want perishable thing in the entire store

212
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:28,164
-最近怎么样？ -很好，很好，大伙还好吗？
-How are you doing! -Fine, fine, how-how is everybody?

213
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,082
大伙还行，你看上状态不错
Great oH, you look good

214
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,934
我们刚搬空了整座超市
We just got this whole store

215
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:33,085
这个过道已经空了
This aisle is empty

216
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:36,105
克里斯，这个过道有什么？ -有空气
-Chris. What is this aisle? -It is empty

217
00:12:36,105 --> 00:12:39,125
哇，这里原先是摆满物品的
Wow, this was full of stuff, oh my goodness

218
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,044
-这个过道也是空的 -你的银行卡也是！ ！
-And this aisle is empty too -And so is your bank account!

219
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:45,014
扎心又真实，好的，我们出发派送食物到流浪庇护所吧
Sadly yes, alright let's go give it all to a homeless shelter

220
00:12:45,114 --> 00:12:46,248
走
Let's do it

221
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:48,467
虽然花了很长时间，但我们最终付清了全部账单
So it took quite a while but we ended up paying the full bill

222
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,919
大概7万美金
it was like $70,000,

223
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,688
这些再加上我们临时工的薪水
we got it all covered plus whatever we spent on the other people

224
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,457
最终我们还是花了一大堆钱
so we ended up spending quite a bit

225
00:12:54,457 --> 00:12:55,724
她要打印收据了
She's about to print the receipt

226
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:58,244
绝对会很有趣
This is gonna be interesting

227
00:13:05,878 --> 00:13:08,687
价值$7万美元的杂货
Seventy thousand dollars worth groceries

228
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:09,421
来一个领带
They made me a tie

229
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:18,531
$7万美金，这是我一生中见过的最昂贵的时刻
$70,000, this is the most expensive time I ever seen in my life

230
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:21,133
疯了，你喜欢吗？
That is insane, you like it?

231
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:25,104
你们都应该试试，只需要花费$7万美金，还可以得到
You guys should try this, just go spin 70 grand and

232
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,339
一个收据领带，快看那个收据有多长，
you can have a receipt-tie. Look how big that is,

233
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,427
大概有20英尺，$7万美金的杂货收据
that'sprobably like a 20-foot receipt, $70000 dollars

234
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,902
我们在食物银行，然后我们要给他们食物
Alright, we're at a food bank and we're gonna give them food

235
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,829
哇，这真是堆起来了，吉米
Wow this is stacking up. Jimmy

236
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:53,465
是啊，就像学校贷款，和美国
It is, like college debt and America.

237
00:13:55,017 --> 00:13:57,653
德尔塔C9军事行动按计划进行中
Military operation deltas c9 is going according to plan

238
00:13:57,653 --> 00:14:01,473
-哦，瞧瞧这个 -喔，这些，这些是我的！！
-Oh look at this -Oh ho woow, these are these are mine

239
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,961
维京人好这口，好的，懂了
Oh Vikings like, okay alright

240
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:10,165
哦，这个已经打开了，你懂的
Alright, this one already open, that's you already know that means

241

小钱钱，你丫在干嘛？

242
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,268
我们得喂饱每个人是吧！！ 嘿，我很好，但我觉得
We got to feed everybody! hey, I'm good I think

243
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:13,736
那边有个人需要点吃的
there's somebody over there they needs

244
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,355
-我马上回来 -他刚是拿了蜂蜜面包是吗？
-I'll be right back -Did he just take the honey buns?

245
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,440
我想他刚刚拿了一堆蜂蜜小面包跑了
I think he just took a bunch of honey buns

246
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,359
钱德勒，这是给无家可归的人准备的。还回来！！
Chandler, those for homeless people. Give it back

247
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,564
-我能有一个吗？ -不行！
-Can I have one? -No

248
00:14:25,581 --> 00:14:26,432
甜蜜面包侠

249
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,420
这刚从他的口袋掉出来
This just fell out of his pocket

250
00:14:33,722 --> 00:14:34,707
别什么？
Not what?

251
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:43,032
好的，好奇里面装了些什么？谁能想到呢！！
Alright, I wonder how full this.. Who would have thought?

252
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:47,386
更多食物，更多箱子，哇~

00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:11,110
好的，这就是我们的全部
All right, so this is all the stuff we had in the emos

254
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,129
我想观众们比较好奇这些食物的去向
I guess people are probably curious what is it gonna go towards

255
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:18,484
好的，我们每周服务1,000至1,500人
well, we serve anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 people a week

256
00:15:23,372 --> 00:15:25,841
我很惊讶我们能把所有的东西都放进去
I'm surprised we could fit all that stuff we did in there

257
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,159
所以他最终会交给需要它的人们（鼓掌）
So it's going to people that need it

好了，伙计们，这个视频真的很贵
Alright guys, this video was actually really expensive

261
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:35,768
我需要你去买点商品
I need you to go invest and merch

262
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,353
因为你不买一些商品
because of you don't buy merch

263
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,089
我在未来也就做不起这样的事情
I just can't afford to do stuff like this in the future

264
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,226
看这个野兽磨砂连帽衫和这个办公室连帽衫，他们真的很帅气！

00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,668
来ShopMrBeast买点商品

让我有能力在未来继续做这种慈善的活动

00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:56,221
爱你们

And there you have it, folks, every single thing we bought will go to help

272
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,360
或者一些单纯需要帮助的人，
low-income families or just people who need it in general,

273
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,428
所以我真的很高兴做了这些
so I'm really happy about that

274
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,397
哦，对了，我们当时也买了很多杂货给顾客
