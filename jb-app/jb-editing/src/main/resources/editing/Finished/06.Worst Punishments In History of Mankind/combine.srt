1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,378
在正义方面，古波斯帝国可以说是严酷而公正的。
In terms of justice, the ancient Persian Empire could be said to have been harsh, but fair.

2
00:00:05,378 --> 00:00:09,424
它的法典中包含“lex talionis”的准则，表示以眼还眼，以牙
The criminal code included the principal of “lex talionis”, an eye for an eye, tooth

3
00:00:09,424 --> 00:00:14,262
还牙，轻者通常会处以罚款，还可能被冠以诽谤的烙印，
for a tooth, misdemeanors usually warranted fines, you might be branded for slander,

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,681
而对于严厉的罪行，将会被处以死刑。
and for the worst crimes you would get the death penalty.

5
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,101
死刑有“两振出局”的规则，这意味着某人不会因为初犯
On occasions there was a two strikes rule, meaning someone wouldn’t be executed for

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:21,436
而被处死。
their first offense.

7
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,355
所以，在古波斯，两次重罪就要见上帝。
So, there you are in ancient Persia, two strikes down.

8
00:00:24,355 --> 00:00:27,442
你想知道死刑如何会被判罚。
You are wondering how the death penalty will be metered out.

9
00:00:27,442 --> 00:00:31,988
是有可能被灰烬窒息？或是把熔化的黄金倾注到受刑者的喉咙
Will it be suffocation by ashes perhaps, or maybe having molten gold poured down your

10
00:00:31,988 --> 00:00:35,283
就像罗马皇帝瓦勒良（传言俘虏后被波斯人倾注黄金致死）可能经历的那样。
throat as what might have happened to the Roman emperor Valerian.

11
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:40,038
很难说那个更糟，但是今天我们认为有一种波斯的刑罚措施
It’s hard to say which would be worse, but today we think have a Persian punishment that

12
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:41,998
是其中最为残酷的。
was the most brutal of them all.

13
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:46,002
虽然古波斯人确实有严格的关于正义的法律，
While the ancient Persians did have strict laws pertaining to matters of justice,

14
00:00:46,002 --> 00:00:49,672
但如同我们要讲的，这不能总是阻止他们变得异常残忍。
as we said, that didn’t at times stop them from being tremendously brutal.

15
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:53,760
在讨论最严重的刑罚之前，我们会再举几个
We’ll give you a few more examples before we get to possibly the worst punishment of

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,761
例子。
them all.

17
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:57,638
这有一位古波斯法官锡桑内斯（Sisamnes）处死的故事。
Take for example the death of a Persian judge called Sisamnes.

18
00:00:57,638 --> 00:01:04,562
据说他很贪腐，公元前530年至公元前522年在位的波斯国王，冈比西斯二世
It’s said that he was corrupt and King Cambyses II of Persia who ruled from 530 BC to 522

19
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:08,524
想要以他为事例，警告那些其他想要
BC wanted to make an example out of him as a warning to others who might think about

20
00:01:08,524 --> 00:01:09,525
腐蚀法庭的人。
corrupting the courts.

21
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:13,821
据说该法官从头到脚被剥皮，然后用他的外皮做了
It’s said the judge was flayed from head to toe and then his skin was used to make

22
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:14,822
一把椅子。
a chair.

23
00:01:14,822 --> 00:01:18,743
正如故事所说，之后任何被任命为法官的人都必须在那张椅子上
As the tale goes, anyone appointed from then on as a judge would have to spend some time

24
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:23,039
坐上一段时间，这样他们就会了解如果自己贪腐的下场。
sitting in that chair so they would know what would happen if they were corrupt.

25
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:27,293
你可以在“The Arrest of Sisamnes”和“Flaying of Sisamnes”
You can see this horrific spectacle in the paintings “The Arrest of Sisamnes” and

26
00:01:27,293 --> 00:01:28,795
两幅画作中看到这种可怕的场景。
“Flaying of Sisamnes.”

27
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:30,838
然后就是居鲁士大帝（Cyrus the Great）的故事。
Then there’s the story of Cyrus the Great.

28
00:01:30,838 --> 00:01:34,634
据记载，他的妻子对她的一位太监感到非常不满。
It’s written that his wife became quite unhappy with one of her eunuchs.

29
00:01:34,634 --> 00:01:38,596
事实上她很不高兴，并下令将他杀死3次。
So unhappy in fact, that she ordered that he be killed three times.

30
00:01:38,596 --> 00:01:39,972
这被称为三重死亡。
This is called The Triple Death.

31
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:44,602
首先他的眼睛被挖掉，然后被看护了到健康状态。
It’s said first his eyes were pulled from his head, but then he was nursed back to health.

32
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:49,023
第二次死亡是被剥皮，但是他又得到了护理，所以也没有死。
His second death was being flayed, but again he was nursed so he wouldn’t die.

33
00:01:49,023 --> 00:01:53,111
当然我们认为他没有被完全剥皮，因为那只会导致死亡。
We imagine he couldn’t have been completely flayed as that resulted in certain death.

34
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,614
当他好一些时，会被钉在十字架上处死，这样执行就完成了。
When he was better he was then crucified and the job was done.

35
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:59,367
然而，我们会说这个故事有很多版本。
We should say, however, that there are many versions of this tale.

36
00:01:59,367 --> 00:02:00,868
但现在我们将坚持使用上述的版本。
We’ll stick with this one for now.

37
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:04,872
那么，考虑到上述的两次处决，还会有更惨的故事发生吗？
So, with these two executions in mind, could there really be anything worse?

38
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,543
好吧，现在我们必须要看一个叫做米特拉达梯（Mithridates）的男人的故事。
Well, now we have to look at the story of a man called Mithridates.

39
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:12,004
他是一个年轻的波斯士兵，于公元前401年被处死。
He was a young Persian soldier who was put to death in 401BC.

40
00:02:12,004 --> 00:02:16,717
据说这个人意外杀死了谋逆的叛逆者赛勒斯（Cyrus the Younger），
It’s said this man accidentally killed Cyrus the Younger, the rebel who was intending to

41
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,971
他意图杀死哥哥阿尔萨斯（Arsaces），以便可以继承王位。
kill his older brother Arsaces so he could inherit the throne.

42
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:24,559
成千上万的人在追随着赛勒斯，这场战争在库纳萨战役中达到高潮。
Thousands of men were behind Cyrus and this culminated in the Battle of Cunaxa.

43
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,730
赛勒斯的军队在向阿尔萨斯的军队冲锋之后占据了上风，一切进展顺利，
Cyrus’ army got the upper hand after charging Artaxerxes' army, all was going well, the

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,566
王位就在他眼前。
throne was in his sights.

45
00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:35,945
赛勒斯紧接着攻击了他哥哥的私人护卫，然后……哎呀……不知打哪来的
Cyrus then went to attack his brother’s personal bodyguard and then…oops…out of

46
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:39,031
标枪击中并当场杀死了他。
nowhere a javelin just hit him and killed him on the spot.

47
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:42,326
这对叛军来说是巨大的挫折，然后就全都撤退了。
This was a huge setback for the rebels and they all retreated.

48
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:44,662
他们未来的国王已经死了，一切都结束了。
Their future king was dead, it was over.

49
00:02:44,662 --> 00:02:48,833
我们知道这些是因为这个故事是由希腊传记作家普鲁塔克（Plutarch）在他的
We know this because the story was recorded by the Greek biographer Plutarch in his essay

50
00:02:48,833 --> 00:02:50,751
撰文中记录的叫做“阿尔萨斯的一生”。
the “Life of Artaxerxes.”

51
00:02:50,751 --> 00:02:55,214
另一位名叫希提亚斯（Ctesias）的希腊作家告诉普鲁塔克了那个用标枪意外
Another Greek writer called Ctesias told Plutarch of the fate of the man that accidentally killed

52
00:02:55,214 --> 00:02:56,799
杀死塞勒斯的人的命运。
Cyrus with that javelin.

53
00:02:56,799 --> 00:02:58,718
如你所知，他的名字叫米特拉达梯。
As you know, his name was Mithridates.

54
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:03,556
可以理解的是也许有些人对米特拉达梯感到些许恼火，
It’s understandable perhaps that some people were perhaps a bit miffed with Mithridates.

55
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:07,935
只有最严厉的惩罚才能奏效，这就是船刑的由来。
Only the severest of punishments would do, and that’s where scaphism comes in.

56
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:11,898
普鲁塔克是这样描述这种非常不寻常的极刑的。
This is how Plutarch describes this very unusual kind of death penalty.

57
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:14,859
由于他的语言有些过时，我们会予以改述。
We will paraphrase as his language is a bit dated now.

58
00:03:14,859 --> 00:03:19,155
将两艘大小相等的船上下叠放并钉死。
So, two boats of equal size were put on top of each other and nailed together.

59
00:03:19,363 --> 00:03:21,324
有点像一个浮动的棺材。
It kind of made a floating coffin.

60
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:25,203
在船上打洞，以便囚犯可以被固定在船上，但同时
Holes were made in the boats so that the prisoner could be fastened in the them but with his

61
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:27,121
双手，双脚和头部要漏出来。
hands, feet and head sticking out.

62
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:28,331
要目前为止还算平常。
So far so good.

63
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:31,876
他在漂浮，头向外伸出，身体也越来越热。
He was floating, his head was protruding, he was getting rather hot.

64
00:03:31,876 --> 00:03:34,378
炽热的光线灼烧着他的脸。
He was left there with the hot sun shining on his face.

65
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:37,381
身体也在漂浮的坟墓中烤的滚烫。
His body was baking hot inside the floating tomb.

66
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:42,386
然后，他们会强制给米特拉达梯适量的喂食牛奶和蜂蜜，
They then force fed Mithridates milk and honey, and in good size portions, too.

67
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,096
并把食物涂抹到他的脸上。
They also covered his face with the stuff.

68
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:49,227
很快，他被蜂蜜覆盖的脸则被苍蝇铺满，苍蝇以他的脸部为餐桌大肆的进食着。
Soon his honey-covered face was covered with flies that were feasting on him and the honey.

69
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:54,065
然后，米特拉达梯被强制吃的越来越多，直到他的胸腹张开并且产生了
He was then force fed more and more until his belly was distended and he had produced

70
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:55,942
大量的排泄物。
quite the pile of excrement.

71
00:03:55,942 --> 00:04:00,363
此时的景象如普鲁塔克所说，“蠕动的蛆虫
At this point, as Plutarch said, “creeping things and vermin spring out of the corruption

72
00:04:00,363 --> 00:04:02,156
在腐烂的排泄物中滋生。”
and rottenness of the excrement.”

73
00:04:02,156 --> 00:04:07,245
这些东西进入了米特拉达梯的肠子，而他的肉也正在从外面
These things entered Mithridates’ bowels, while his flesh was slowly being eaten too

74
00:04:07,245 --> 00:04:08,329
慢慢被吃掉。
from the outside.

75
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,875
据说这种蠕虫的缓慢进食持续了17天。
This slow devouring by insects and vermin it’s said lasted 17 days.

76
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:18,256
到最后，可怜，年轻，标枪技术感人的米特拉达梯就这样被活生生的吃掉了。
At that point, poor, young Mithridates with the bad javelin shot was eaten alive.

77
00:04:18,256 --> 00:04:22,969
十二世纪的拜占庭编年史学家乔安妮斯（Joannes）对此作了另一种描述。
There was another description of this by a 12th-century Byzantine chronicler

78
00:04:22,969 --> 00:04:27,056
确实是同一故事，但她对这个故事有所修饰。
called Joannes Zonaras. It’s really the same story, but he embellished the tale somewhat.

79
00:04:27,056 --> 00:04:29,642
这是逐词翻译的结论：
This is the conclusion, word for word in translation:

80
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:34,564
“被蜂蜜吸引的苍蝇，蜜蜂和黄蜂落在他的脸上和所有
“Flies, wasps, and bees, attracted by the sweetness, settle on his face and all such

81
00:04:34,564 --> 00:04:39,485
裸漏在船外的部分，痛苦地折磨和刺痛这个
parts of him as project outside the boats, and miserably torment and sting

82
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:40,695
可怜的男人
the wretched man.

83
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:45,366
此外，他的胸腹因牛奶和蜂蜜的膨胀而胀开，排出液体排泄物，
Moreover his belly, distended as it is with milk and honey, throws off liquid excrements,

84
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:49,370
这些腐败滋生出各式各样的肠堆，和其围绕进食的蠕虫。
and these putrefying breed swarms of worms, intestinal and of all sorts.

85
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:53,749
受害者躺在船上，他的身躯在自己的污秽中腐烂，并被虫子吞食，
Thus the victim lying in the boats, his flesh rotting away in his own filth and devoured

86
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:57,336
一种拖延，恐怖的死法。”
by worms, dies a lingering and horrible death.”

87
00:04:57,336 --> 00:05:00,339
但史上只有这一例船刑吗?
But is that it, just one case of scaphism throughout history?

88
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,802
好吧，看上去所有人讨论的和上述的是同一个，
Well, it seems like the one case everyone talks about is the one we just described,

89
00:05:04,802 --> 00:05:09,390
尽管大多数资料都称”船刑”是一种古老的惩罚措施，就像会时常发生的
although most sources call scaphism an ancient form of punishment as if it happened time

90
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,391
一样。
and again.

91
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,519
我们确实从《基督教殉道史》一书中有所摘录。
We did find an excerpt from a book called “The History of Christian Martyrdom.”

92
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,899
这本书中记载了公元363年一位名叫马库斯（Marcus）的主教摧毁了一座异教寺庙，
In that book it’s written that a bishop called Marcus in 363 AD destroyed a pagan

93
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,818
然后建立了一座教堂。
temple and then erected a church.

94
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:23,904
罗马皇帝朱利安对此很不买账。
This didn’t go down well with Roman emperor Julian the Apostate.

95
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:27,992
书中记载作为惩罚，他把马库斯吊在一个篮子里，
It’s written that as punishment he took Marcus and hung him up in a basket and left

96
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,369
让他在那里被昆虫盛宴。
him there to be feasted on by insects.

97
00:05:30,369 --> 00:05:34,624
但这更像是一个死在烈日下的案例，而不是硬核的船刑措施。
But this seems like a case of dying in the hot sun rather than hardcore scaphism.

98
00:05:34,624 --> 00:05:38,461
事实上在“Wiki Talk“的页面上有很多关于船刑的争论，
There’s actually quite the debate about scaphism on the Wiki Talk page, with some

99
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:42,381
一些写者质疑普鲁塔克的真实性，并询问其他来源支持。
editors questioning the veracity of Plutarch and asking for other sources.

100
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:46,218
普鲁塔克确实写了关于船刑的论述，但一些历史学家认为他可能
Plutarch did indeed write that account of scaphism, but some historians believe he may

101
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:50,640
是为了妖魔化波斯人并使他自己的文化看起来更好。
have done so to demonize the Persians and make his own culture look better.

102
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,478
我们永远不会确切地知道普鲁塔克发生了什么，但是上述则是现在流行最广的
We will never know exactly what happened to Mithridates, but right now that’s the prevailing

103
00:05:55,686 --> 00:05:56,687
船刑版本。
story.

104
00:05:56,687 --> 00:06:00,608
也许他是唯一一个知道全部过程的人，也可能老普鲁塔克只是
Perhaps he was the only man ever to get the full dose of scaphism, or maybe old Plutarch

105
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,943
是古时期的一个虚假新闻出版商。
was an ancient publisher of fake news.

106
00:06:02,943 --> 00:06:05,655
那么，我们是否找到了有史以来最恶劣的惩罚？
So, did we find the worst punishment of all time?
