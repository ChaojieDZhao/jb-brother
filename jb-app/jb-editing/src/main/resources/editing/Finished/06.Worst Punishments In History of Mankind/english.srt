1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,410
In terms of justice, the ancient Persian Empire could be said to have been harsh, but fair.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:09,460
The criminal code included the principal of “lex talionis”, an eye for an eye, tooth

3
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:14,290
for a tooth, misdemeanors usually warranted fines, you might be branded for slander, and

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,710
for the worst crimes you would get the death penalty.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,129
On occasions there was a two strikes rule, meaning someone wouldn’t be executed for

6
00:00:20,329 --> 00:00:21,449
their first offense.

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,379
So, there you are in ancient Persia, two strikes down.

8
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,460
You are wondering how the death penalty will be metered out.

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,020
Will it be suffocation by ashes perhaps, or maybe having molten gold poured down your

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,320
throat as what might have happened to the Roman emperor Valerian.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,039
It’s hard to say which would be worse, but today we think have a Persian punishment that

12
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,030
was the most brutal of them all.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,009
While the ancient Persians did have strict laws pertaining to matters of justice, as

14
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:49,679
we said, that didn’t at times stop them from being tremendously brutal.

15
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,799
We’ll give you a few more examples before we get to possibly the worst punishment of

16
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:54,799
them all.

17
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,659
Take for example the death of a Persian judge called Sisamnes.

18
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:04,569
It’s said that he was corrupt and King Cambyses II of Persia who ruled from 530 BC to 522

19
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:08,559
BC wanted to make an example out of him as a warning to others who might think about

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,539
corrupting the courts.

21
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:13,829
It’s said the judge was flayed from head to toe and then his skin was used to make

22
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:14,829
a chair.

23
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:18,750
As the tale goes, anyone appointed from then on as a judge would have to spend some time

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:23,079
sitting in that chair so they would know what would happen if they were corrupt.

25
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,298
You can see this horrific spectacle in the paintings “The Arrest of Sisamnes” and

26
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,819
“Flaying of Sisamnes.”

27
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:30,868
Then there’s the story of Cyrus the Great.

28
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,670
It’s written that his wife became quite unhappy with one of her eunuchs.

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,629
So unhappy in fact, that she ordered that he be killed three times.

30
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:39,978
This is called The Triple Death.

31
00:01:39,978 --> 00:01:44,609
It’s said first his eyes were pulled from his head, but then he was nursed back to health.

32
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:49,060
His second death was being flayed, but again he was nursed so he wouldn’t die.

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,120
We imagine he couldn’t have been completely flayed as that resulted in certain death.

34
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,650
When he was better he was then crucified and the job was done.

35
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,400
We should say, however, that there are many versions of this tale.

36
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,890
We’ll stick with this one for now.

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,909
So, with these two executions in mind, could there really be anything worse?

38
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:08,549
Well, now we have to look at the story of a man called Mithridates.

39
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,019
He was a young Persian soldier who was put to death in 401BC.

40
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,739
It’s said this man accidentally killed Cyrus the Younger, the rebel who was intending to

41
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,009
kill his older brother Arsaces so he could inherit the throne.

42
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:24,628
Thousands of men were behind Cyrus and this culminated in the Battle of Cunaxa.

43
00:02:24,628 --> 00:02:29,739
Cyrus’ army got the upper hand after charging Artaxerxes' army, all was going well, the

44
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,579
throne was in his sights.

45
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,959
Cyrus then went to attack his brother’s personal bodyguard and then…oops…out of

46
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,049
nowhere a javelin just hit him and killed him on the spot.

47
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:42,340
This was a huge setback for the rebels and they all retreated.

48
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,688
Their future king was dead, it was over.

49
00:02:44,688 --> 00:02:48,870
We know this because the story was recorded by the Greek biographer Plutarch in his essay

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,778
the “Life of Artaxerxes.”

51
00:02:50,778 --> 00:02:55,229
Another Greek writer called Ctesias told Plutarch of the fate of the man that accidentally killed

52
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:56,828
Cyrus with that javelin.

53
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,719
As you know, his name was Mithridates.

54
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:03,578
It’s understandable perhaps that some people were perhaps a bit miffed with Mithridates.

55
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,968
Only the severest of punishments would do, and that’s where scaphism comes in.

56
00:03:07,968 --> 00:03:11,900
This is how Plutarch describes this very unusual kind of death penalty.

57
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,900
We will paraphrase as his  is a bit dated now.

58
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,179
So, two boats of equal size were put on top of each other and nailed together.

59
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:21,348
It kind of made a floating coffin.

60
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:25,219
Holes were made in the boats so that the prisoner could be fastened in the them but with his

61
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,128
hands, feet and head sticking out.

62
00:03:27,128 --> 00:03:28,348
So far so good.

63
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:31,899
He was floating, his head was protruding, he was getting rather hot.

64
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,399
He was left there with the hot sun shining on his face.

65
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:37,389
His body was baking hot inside the floating tomb.

66
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:42,408
They then force fed Mithridates milk and honey, and in good size portions, too.

67
00:03:42,408 --> 00:03:44,120
They also covered his face with the stuff.

68
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,259
Soon his honey-covered face was covered with flies that were feasting on him and the honey.

69
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,088
He was then force fed more and more until his belly was distended and he had produced

70
00:03:54,088 --> 00:03:55,968
quite the pile of excrement.

71
00:03:55,968 --> 00:04:00,388
At this point, as Plutarch said, “creeping things and vermin spring out of the corruption

72
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,169
and rottenness of the excrement.”

73
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:07,269
These things entered Mithridates’ bowels, while his flesh was slowly being eaten too

74
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:08,338
from the outside.

75
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:12,878
This slow devouring by insects and vermin it’s said lasted 17 days.

76
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:18,259
At that point, poor, young Mithridates with the bad javelin shot was eaten alive.

77
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:23,000
There was another description of this by a 12th-century Byzantine chronicler called Joannes

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Zonaras.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,089
It’s really the same story, but he embellished the tale somewhat.

80
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:29,669
This is the conclusion, word for word in translation:

81
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,569
“Flies, wasps, and bees, attracted by the sweetness, settle on his face and all such

82
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,719
parts of him as project outside the boats, and miserably torment and sting the wretched

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
man.

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,370
Moreover his belly, distended as it is with milk and honey, throws off liquid excrements,

85
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,389
and these putrefying breed swarms of worms, intestinal and of all sorts.

86
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,779
Thus the victim lying in the boats, his flesh rotting away in his own filth and devoured

87
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:57,339
by worms, dies a lingering and horrible death.”

88
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:00,369
But is that it, just one case of scaphism throughout history?

89
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,819
Well, it seems like the one case everyone talks about is the one we just described,

90
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:09,430
although most sources call scaphism an ancient form of punishment as if it happened time

91
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,430
and again.

92
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,560
We did find an excerpt from a book called “The History of Christian Martyrdom.”

93
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,910
In that book it’s written that a bishop called Marcus in 363 AD destroyed a pagan

94
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,829
temple and then erected a church.

95
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,909
This didn’t go down well with Roman emperor Julian the Apostate.

96
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,009
It’s written that as punishment he took Marcus and hung him up in a basket and left

97
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:30,370
him there to be feasted on by insects.

98
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:34,639
But this seems like a case of dying in the hot sun rather than hardcore scaphism.

99
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,469
There’s actually quite the debate about scaphism on the Wiki Talk page, with some

100
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,420
editors questioning the veracity of Plutarch and asking for other sources.

101
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,259
Plutarch did indeed write that account of scaphism, but some historians believe he may

102
00:05:46,459 --> 00:05:50,669
have done so to demonize the Persians and make his own culture look better.

103
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:55,509
We will never know exactly what happened to Mithridates, but right now that’s the prevailing

104
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:56,709
story.

105
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:00,620
Perhaps he was the only man ever to get the full dose of scaphism, or maybe old Plutarch

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,970
was an ancient publisher of fake news.

107
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,689
So, did we find the worst punishment of all time?
