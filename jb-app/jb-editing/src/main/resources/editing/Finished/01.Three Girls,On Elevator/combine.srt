00:00:25,433 --> 00:00:27,399
天呐，希望我衣服也能那样合身，
God, I wish my clothes fit like that,

2
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,205
她身体曲线就像个活的美元符号$
her curves look like a dollar sign came to life, man

3
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:32,955
好烦啊，我的提臀裤老是扭啊扭的

4
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:36,221
她的头发太好看了吧？
How is her hair such goals?

5
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,221
她真是个长发公主
She's actually Rapunzel

6
00:00:39,276 --> 00:00:41,682
这高跟鞋也太酷了，希望我也能穿上
Those pumps are fire, I wish I could walk

7
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:43,464
in heels like her, she came in here
这样的鞋子走路。她进来时

8
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:46,397
looking like Naomi Campbell walk, Naomi Campbell walk,

00:00:46,397 --> 00:00:48,147
my ankles would snap
要是我的话脚踝就断了

10
00:00:49,663 --> 00:00:51,822
Oh come on, man, her eyebrows are the literal
厉害，她的眉毛就是字面意思

11
00:00:51,822 --> 00:00:54,399
fleek的定义，我敢说，这是
definition of fleek, and I bet those are

12
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,055
她真正的睫毛。

00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:58,298
Oh, her eyeballs are so protected.

Oh this sucks, I'm in an elevator with two Malibu Barbies.
噢，真糟糕，我和两个马里布芭比娃娃一起在电梯里。

00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:07,681
Are you guys going down?
你们要下去吗？

16
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:09,235
下来，是的。
Down, yeah, yeah.

抱歉，我往上去。
Ah, sorry, I'm going up.

18
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,674
我是说他很可爱，但那些甜甜圈更吸引人。
I mean he was cute but, those donuts though.

19
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:19,296
同感，对于釉面甜甜圈，我们可以
I know, for a glazed doughnut, we can take

20
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,561
high一会儿了。
a little ride up for a second.

21
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,804
他可以把甜甜圈留给我们，
I mean, leave the glazed doughnuts with us,

22
00:01:22,804 --> 00:01:24,080
然后去走楼梯。
you can take the stairs.

23
00:01:25,805 --> 00:01:28,415
BT配靓女，这身装扮太给力了。

哦，谢谢。

00:01:32,238 --> 00:01:33,071
真的，真心实意，
I mean, that's true and all,

28
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:34,570
但是我还在想那些甜甜圈。
but I'm still thinking about those doughnuts.

29
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,330
噢，天哪，会抓重点。
Oh my God, priorities on fleek.

30
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:41,997
我们去找那些甜甜圈。
Let's go find those doughnuts.

31
00:01:41,997 --> 00:01:44,375
为什么我们不刚进电梯就开始说话？

不然我们五分钟之前就是好朋友了。

说到好友，我要借你的鞋子穿穿，

35
00:01:47,909 --> 00:00:00,000
还有脚踝护具。
