1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,045
- So you're okay with me
cutting the final rope?

2
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:02,878
- [Speaker In Blue] Oh my god.

3
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,615
- We're cutting the final rope!

4
00:00:04,615 --> 00:00:07,443
(dramatic rock music)|
Three, two, one, cut!

5
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:09,511
This could equal a million dollars.

6
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:12,102
(shouting)
(splashing)

7
00:00:12,102 --> 00:00:14,740
(video rewinding)

8
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,850
How's it feel?

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,683
- It's kind of scary.

10
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,960
- [Host] And welcome
to the number two slot.

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,793
How do you feel?

12
00:00:19,793 --> 00:00:20,840
- I'm good, I'm ready to win.

13
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,180
- [Host] Is this easy or harder

14
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,094
than you thought it would be?

15
00:00:23,094 --> 00:00:25,040
- I'm not gonna say 'cause
y'all are gonna make it harder.

16
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,080
- [Host] How do you feel?

17
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,360
- Freaking out, not gonna lie.

18
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,850
I have huge fear of heights.

19
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:30,510
- [Host] Last one of you guys to fall

20
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,940
into this pool of water,

21
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,740
gets the chance at one million dollars.

22
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,850
- No way!

23
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:35,683
- And here's what I mean by that.

24
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:38,510
We are going four last to leave videos

25
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,350
and the winners of each will
compete in a fifth video

26
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,700
for one million dollars.

27
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,220
You are currently watching
part one of this series.

28
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,080
I don't care who wins,

29
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,430
but whoever does, will
fly back in a few weeks

30
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,350
and compete against the other
winners for a million dollars.

31
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,100
This is arguably the most
extreme thing we've ever done.

32
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,040
See this cage?

33
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,910
We took it from American
Warrior Ninja, that thing.

34
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,100
We put some ropes and we
put some people on it.

35
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,450
And we grabbed a million dollars

36
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:03,680
and that's how we ended up here.

37
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,060
So as I said Chris, we're
doing four last to leaves,

38
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,020
this is the first one.

39
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,290
And the winners of all
four compete in a fifth one

40
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,320
for one million dollars.

41
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,960
Which means there's three more.

42
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,490
- So how you gonna pick
all the other people?

43
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,323
- I'm glad you asked.

44
00:01:14,323 --> 00:01:15,156
Here's how.

45
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:17,470
If you buy merch, or
follow me on Instagram,

46
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,303
you'll be entered.

47
00:01:18,303 --> 00:01:19,136
It's that simple.

48
00:01:19,136 --> 00:01:21,270
We're gonna randomly pick people
who follow me on Instagram

49
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,936
or people who buy merch in between now

50
00:01:22,936 --> 00:01:24,330
and the next few challenges

51
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,990
and we're gonna invite
'em down to compete.

52
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,770
And I'll remind you about
that at the end of the video.

53
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,840
So we gave each of you guys a coach

54
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,380
and we made them wear the same shirt

55
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,550
so the viewers could tell.

56
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,490
Cameron, your coach is Chris.

57
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:36,520
Alberto you have Marcus.

58
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,680
Colby, we brought you a Chandler,

59
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,410
so you can just go ahead
and just get out now

60
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,789
if you want to.
- No!

61
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,622
Don't say that!

62
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:44,700
- [Host] And you are assigned the big guy.

63
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,040
So there you go, you each have a coach,

64
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,100
they'll get you whatever you need.

65
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,300
Whoever falls last gets to move on

66
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,770
and compete for one
million dollars, good luck.

67
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,330
- I want to see if I can
get you a bottle of water

68
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,130
like up there, let's give it a shot.

69
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,570
Kobe!
- Ah, oh!

70
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,775
- Cameron, this matches your shirt.

71
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:03,020
(grunting)
(laughing)

72
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,160
- [Host] Oh good catch!

73
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,002
- A banana for you.
(banana whizzing)

74
00:02:06,002 --> 00:02:07,701
A banana for you!
- Wait, wait, wait.

75
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:08,997
- Hello!
- Whoa!

76
00:02:08,997 --> 00:02:11,950
(exclaiming)
(clapping)

77
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,255
- [Chris] He didn't even move!

78
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:14,540
(upbeat electronic music)

79
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,350
- Uh, huh, uh, huh, huh, uh, huh.

80
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,260
- So Chris, we're gonna
do our first challenge.

81
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,460
There's seats behind you

82
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,720
and you can earn time for
sitting to help you win.

83
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,990
The first challenge for
one minute of sitting,

84
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,930
you have to throw your
contestant this egg,

85
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,040
and he has to toss it
back, without a crack.

86
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,340
And if you do that, he can sit.

87
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,396
- Dude, I was never good
at sports, underhand.

88
00:02:32,396 --> 00:02:33,551
(exclaiming)
(egg splashing)

89
00:02:33,551 --> 00:02:35,132
- All right.
(laughing)

90
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,010
- Bloop!

91
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,757
- All right, Marcus.

92
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,757
- Oh my God.

93
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,693
- Here's an egg.

94
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:44,190
- Great shot!
- And if Chandler catches this

95
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,193
you get to sit.

96
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,872
Ooh there we go!
(clapping)

97
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:48,830
And no cracks.

98
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,730
So since they completed the egg challenge,

99
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,800
she gets a little bit of sitting time.

100
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,860
There's your seat.

101
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,910
Colby gets to sit for the next minute.

102
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,743
Congrats!
(slapping)

103
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:57,950
You're helping your contestant.

104
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,950
While Colby's wrapping
up her sitting time,

105
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,700
let's see if you can earn him some.

106
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:05,340
- Perfect!
(gasping)

107
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,320
- Ah!
(clapping)

108
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,820
- It is perfect.

109
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,130
I will lower the seat.

110
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,070
So, Colby, your minute is up, stand up.

111
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,450
Try not to fall.

112
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,590
And now we will take her seat back.

113
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,440
And Jake's contestant
wants some sitting time,

114
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,291
so we give him his seat.
- Coming down behind ya!

115
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,930
(clapping)
- There it is, yeah!

116
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,980
- One final thing,

117
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,610
if your contestant wins,

118
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,440
they go on to compete
for a million dollars.

119
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,120
To incentivize you guys
to help your players win,

120
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,453
if they win the million dollars,
they have to give you 10%.

121
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:34,970
- Ooh, you better win.
- To incentivize you guys.

122
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,220
- I'll get you anything you need.

123
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,870
- That's $100 grand, and
they still win $900 grand.

124
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,040
Now that you guys also
have money on the line,

125
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,453
let's do the egg challenge
again, but from further back.

126
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,451
This time it's for five
minutes instead of one.

127
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:49,760
Don't cross that, we have a
million dollars on the line

128
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,030
and our markers a bag of chips.

129
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,950
This time we'll just do if he catches it.

130
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,475
He can sit for five minutes.

131
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:56,481
(soft synthesized music)
(gasping)

132
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:57,898
- Aw!
- It's good!

133
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,374
- [Chandler] Did that go between his legs?

134
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,690
- Yeah it did.

135
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,723
- Not it.
- Nope.

136
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:05,510
(smacking)
- Oh!

137
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,343
(growling)

138
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:07,250
- That's five minutes.

139
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,083
I'll go lower it.

140
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:08,920
- Here you go Colby.

141
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,343
- I bet he's not gonna catch it.

142
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:15,323
(egg splattering)
- Oh no!

143
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,433
- Does that count?

144
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,220
(egg splattering)
(exclaiming)

145
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,839
- Oh my gosh!

146
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,190
Sports, not good at 'em.

147
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,480
So who thinks they're in
first place right now?

148
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,746
- I mean, honestly, right here.

149
00:04:25,746 --> 00:04:26,720
- You think you're first place?

150
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,098
- Yeah.
- Who's that?

151
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:33,098
(heavy rock music)
(siren wailing)

152
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,240
- That was sabotage.

153
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,730
You have to do ten laps around the pool.

154
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,951
You can't throw things at the competitors!

155
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:38,943
- I can do what I want!

156
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,430
- When I smell sabotage,
the lights turn red

157
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,300
and the alarm comes out.
(siren wailing)

158
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,176
- Oh this is gonna be cold.
(upbeat polka music)

159
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:48,356
(water splashing)
(exclaiming)

160
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:49,930
Ack, it's so cold!

161
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:52,162
(upbeat polka music)

162
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:54,160
Well there we go, that's one lap.

163
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
- This is what happens to sabotagers here.

164
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,184
- I'm cold!

165
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,798
(suspenseful instrumental music)

166
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:01,330
- Its getting a bit more difficult.

167
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,100
- Now it's time for our first incentive.

168
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,050
This is the unicorn of gifts.

169
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,610
First person to get out,

170
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,810
can have an iPhone,
Airpods, Beats, and PS4.

171
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,476
Just consider it, I don't care who it is.

172
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:13,530
(crickets chirping)

173
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,510
- Nobody, really?

174
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,370
- No one wants the unicorn of love?

175
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,610
- All right, they're being stubborn,

176
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,140
someone give me a knife.
- Wait a minute, what?

177
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,630
- Things are lasting a while,

178
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,327
red light me.
(ominous electronic music)

179
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:28,790
Ooh there we go!
(laughing and hollering)

180
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,760
- [Host] We'll just cut this rope.

181
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,807
- Hey, don't cut the rope!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

182
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:33,803
No, no--
- Ooh.

183
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,550
- They're down to 16 ropes.

184
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,783
- Oh you're going again, oh.
- Fifteen.

185
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,577
Five of those twenty ropes
are gone, how does it feel?

186
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:46,194
- There's a big difference but--

187
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:48,050
- I don't believe you, I'm cutting more.

188
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:50,400
All right, turn the lights
back to normal, we're good.

189
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,950
- Try again.
(bottle crunching)

190
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,310
- You almost got him out!
(laughing)

191
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,212
- My bad!
(laughing)

192
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,265
(festive bell music)

193
00:05:56,265 --> 00:05:58,767
(ropes snapping)
(exclaiming and laughing)

194
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,660
(festive bell music)

195
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,830
- You guys have ten minutes

196
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,240
to draw a portrait of your contestant.

197
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,840
I will then let people on my
social media vote with a poll

198
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,710
for the best one.

199
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,860
The viewers will decide.

200
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,300
Whoever they vote, gets ten
minutes of sitting down.

201
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,895
Three, two, one.
(clapping)

202
00:06:13,895 --> 00:06:15,547
(energetic banjo music)

203
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:17,610
You know Chandler, I
can't say I'm impressed.

204
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,160
- You can't tell what that is though?

205
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,610
It looks exactly like
what she's doing, right?

206
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,510
- [Host] Oh Chris that looks good.

207
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,644
Trees are lit.

208
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:25,600
(energetic banjo music)

209
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,360
- All right, you ready for this?

210
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,650
- Oh, that's actually not that bad.

211
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,471
- Get ready for this masterpiece son.

212
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:32,730
(gasping)
Do you like it?

213
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,422
- I love it.
- You see it, right?

214
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:36,530
- Uh, yeah, no?

215
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,440
- No?

216
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,419
- Are you ready for this?

217
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:41,005
- That is awesome I like
the looser signs on it.

218
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:41,856
- I drew everything.

219
00:06:41,856 --> 00:06:43,127
So I think this is a winner, you know?

220
00:06:43,127 --> 00:06:44,600
- Are you ready for the beautiful?

221
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,880
I got the peach fuzz and everything,

222
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,290
it's got a W on your
chest, you wanna know why?

223
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,123
Winter.

224
00:06:48,123 --> 00:06:49,770
- So I put a poll out on social media,

225
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:51,220
which by the way, follow my Instagram

226
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,510
if you wanna potentially
be here, next competition.

227
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,310
But regardless, I let you guys vote.

228
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,210
And you guys decided
that Jake is the winner.

229
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,400
- What?
- What?

230
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,233
- Yup.
(dramatic orchestral music)

231
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,635
The winner of nothing, Chris actually won!

232
00:07:02,635 --> 00:07:04,110
- Yeah!
(laughing)

233
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:06,968
- So sad.
(board tapping)

234
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:07,801
- It didn't work.
(painting dropping)

235
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,470
- Oh how does that feel man?

236
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,303
- It feels amazing!

237
00:07:10,303 --> 00:07:12,610
- [Chris] Look at him, he's
laying all the way back!

238
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,352
You guys are jelly right now.

239
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:17,700
(marching band music)

240
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,790
- [Host] It's been getting pretty tough,

241
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,200
so I want you to call a family member

242
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,290
and try to get some motivation.

243
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,880
Hey, how's it going?
(chuckling)

244
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,250
Your brother is suspended above a pool,

245
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,680
and there's four other people,

246
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,220
whoever gets out last gets to
compete for a million dollars.

247
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,053
- Oh my gosh.

248
00:07:30,053 --> 00:07:31,490
- Hey mom, so I didn't tell you,

249
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,945
'cause you'd go off on me probably.

250
00:07:32,945 --> 00:07:34,660
- [Colby's Mom] Why aren't you
calling from your cell phone?

251
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,060
- Mom, it's a competition,
I can't have my phone.

252
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,703
I'm competing to win a million dollars.

253
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,412
- She's saying oh my God are you serious.

254
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,620
- Hey what's up dad?

255
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,220
If I win this one, then
I go back in December

256
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,700
and have a chance to
win a million dollars.

257
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,533
- [Cameron's Dad] You what?

258
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:51,210
That's great man.

259
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,370
- All right contestants,

260
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,760
the unicorn of wealth is coming back.

261
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,740
For whoever gets out next, we
have some Beats, some Airpods,

262
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,630
an iPhone, an Xbox 1, a PS4,

263
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,240
that's what was up there earlier.

264
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,030
And now, we're adding in a MacBook Pro.

265
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,050
(exclaiming)

266
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,669
And some PS4 video games.

267
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:09,870
(exclaiming)

268
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,670
All you have to do is get
out now and you can have 'em.

269
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,920
Even if you win here today,

270
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,670
you're not guaranteed a million dollars.

271
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,910
- That's a lot of stuff though.

272
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,940
- It's about $3,500 dollars.

273
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,320
- Go ahead and do it, somebody do it.

274
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,450
- See right about now is
when Chandler would get out.

275
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,050
- Actually way earlier.
- Yeah, way earlier.

276
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,900
- No I'm just sayin' like
that's a lot of stuff man,

277
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,692
like you know, if you
go along way with that--

278
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:29,268
- So is a million dollars.
- I know.

279
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:30,680
- He's considering it.

280
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,827
- Do it, do it!
- You gotta jump now!

281
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:37,072
(melancholy instrumental music)

282
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:39,289
- [Emperor Palpatine] You're
fulfilling your destiny.

283
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,567
(water splashing)
(slow motion shouting)

284
00:08:42,568 --> 00:08:44,436
- (slow motion exclaiming) Yeah!

285
00:08:44,436 --> 00:08:49,436
- (slow motion shouting)
No, that's so cold!

286
00:08:51,735 --> 00:08:52,773
(water splashing)
(exclaiming)

287
00:08:52,773 --> 00:08:55,023
- Oh!
- No, that's so cold!

288
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,080
- What would your mother
say to you right now?

289
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,028
- Oh my God he gave up a million dollars!

290
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,530
He gave up 900 bands and
gave up your hundred.

291
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:09,040
- We have three more of these,
where you'll also be a coach

292
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,470
and so you still have other chances.

293
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:12,400
Follow me on Instagram or buy merch,

294
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,380
you could have a chance.

295
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,780
- So here's all your items.

296
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,527
- Tell me how you were feeling
when you were up there.

297
00:09:16,527 --> 00:09:18,000
- I was already in pain,

298
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,390
it feels good not to be
up there anymore though.

299
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,945
- Yeah.
- It's no joke.

300
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:21,796
- You were up there for 13 hours.

301
00:09:21,796 --> 00:09:23,129
- 13 hours, man!

302
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,880
- Well, thanks for coming, appreciate it.

303
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,080
I hope you had fun.
- Yeah.

304
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,310
- Alberto, you did a good job, bro.

305
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,690
- [Host] So there's only three of you now.

306
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,050
How does that make you feel?

307
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,240
- I feel hyped, yeah, I feel optimistic.

308
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,956
- [Host] Colby, how do you
feel now that he's gone?

309
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:37,100
- I'm ready, I'm hyped.

310
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,021
- [Host] How about you Cameron?

311
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:39,020
- I feel like I got more space

312
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,230
to kind of just do what I want

313
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,487
and I feel more confident now.

314
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:43,050
- [Host] One of you will get the chance

315
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,600
at winning a million dollars,
the other two, nothing,

316
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,520
so, good luck.

317
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,540
She's moving over to close the gap.

318
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,210
- [Marcus] In honor of Alberto's
exit, we should cut a rope.

319
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,100
- You're right actually.

320
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,260
- In honor of his exit.

321
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,400
Red lights.

322
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,853
We stated with twenty
ropes, we're down to 15.

323
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:59,270
I think we'll just do this.

324
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,840
So now we're down to 14.

325
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,160
Now we're just gonna, 13.

326
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,230
I'll let you guys vote,

327
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,866
should I cut one more?
- No.

328
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,238
- [Host] What do you think Akira?

329
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:08,880
- Yeah.
- Colby what do you think?

330
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,680
- I mean, obviously.
- Okay, that's two yeses.

331
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,410
Whoa, they wanna get this over with.

332
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,470
If I cut another, that puts us at 12.

333
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,000
- Wow.
- We're droppin' ropes.

334
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,340
Twelve it is.
- Wow.

335
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,380
- You guys are running
out of things to stand on.

336
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,400
Lights back to normal, we'll
cut some more ropes later.

337
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,244
Just kidding, turn the red lights back on.

338
00:10:25,244 --> 00:10:27,310
(chuckling)
- Oh my God.

339
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,220
Dude he's not playing with them!

340
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,563
- Sike!  that was just
a joke, normal lights.

341
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,040
(gentle electronic music)

342
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,790
- How many hours have been up here?

343
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,446
- [Tareq] Chrissy, wakie, wakie.

344
00:10:38,446 --> 00:10:39,959
Jakie, wakie, wakie.

345
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,400
Why is there a french fry on his head?

346
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,030
Each of you three still
have a contestant left.

347
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,320
What do you want to say to Cameron?

348
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,030
- He knows he's a beast and a warrior.

349
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,130
- [Host] What do you want to say?

350
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,030
- You're doing amazing.

351
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,810
- You?
(snoring)

352
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,470
Awesome, if someone gets
out within the next minute,

353
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,122
I'll give them $5,000 dollars.

354
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,731
(water splashing)
(upbeat instrumental music)

355
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:59,658
(water splashing)

356
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,710
- (in slow motion) He knows
he's a beast and a warrior.

357
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,310
You love to see it.
(exclaiming)

358
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,448
- That's what you wake up to today.

359
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:07,250
- I tried man, I was dying
for a long time up there.

360
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,080
- You could've had it easy man.

361
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,548
- He looks like he's going pretty strong.

362
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:12,160
- [Host] What are you going
to do with that $5,000?

363
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,520
- I'm gonna donate some trees,
maybe go do some shopping.

364
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,060
- He tried his best,

365
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,920
hey, at least he didn't
go home empty handed.

366
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,928
Poor Colby's gonna go home empty handed.

367
00:11:19,928 --> 00:11:22,580
- [Host] Your contestant
and your contestant remain.

368
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,540
- Yeah.

369
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,470
- [Host] Now that Cameron is
gone, it is you two fighting

370
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,390
for a chance at one million dollars.

371
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,250
- Whoo!

372
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,950
- [Host] So we'll start
off with you Colby.

373
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,829
Cameron's gone, how you feeling?

374
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:35,607
- I'm feeling even more confident.

375
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm here to win that million.

376
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,120
- [Host] How 'bout you,
how are things going now?

377
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,250
- 48.

378
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,860
- He's lasted 48 hours?
- 48, let's go!

379
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,080
- [Host] Okay, whenever
you get tired remember,

380
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,360
a million dollars is a lot

381
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,120
and your brother would be
really sad if you didn't win it.

382
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,953
Okay have fun.

383
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:51,210
(upbeat electronic music)

384
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,420
So Chandler had to leave,

385
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,825
so we're gonna put you in charge of Colby.

386
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,660
- Boo.
(laughing)

387
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,050
- For the next minute,

388
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,810
it'll be ten grand if someone gets out,

389
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,050
then it drops back to seven.

390
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,080
- You can do better Akira.

391
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,620
- You have 55 seconds to decide,

392
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,450
and then it falls back to seven grand.

393
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,950
- That's pushing it, that's a lot.

394
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,080
- You have 40 seconds to win ten grand.

395
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,770
You could just lose in
the million dollar round

396
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,000
and get nothing, when right now,

397
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,470
you could walk away with ten grand.

398
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,077
- Ten grand, we were waiting on this.

399
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:19,260
- Akira, you could take that
10K and split it with your twin

400
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,150
he's be happy with you.

401
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,980
- Or you can play for this million

402
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,480
and potentially win a million dollars.

403
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,940
- But we're in it to win it.

404
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,179
- Yeah!

405
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,588
- Five, four, three, two--
- We came to win,

406
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:31,828
that's right Akira!
(clapping)

407
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:32,661
We came to win!

408
00:12:32,661 --> 00:12:34,890
- That is a very tired but determined man.

409
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:35,930
- I love that Akira.

410
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,990
- Seven grand's still on
the table, take it whenever.

411
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,480
Rope cutting time.

412
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,377
Once I start cutting some ropes,

413
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,040
one of you are gonna fall.

414
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,090
- Here we go!
- One down.

415
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,923
- [Jake] That's two.

416
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,113
- [Host] Three down.

417
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:50,003
Akira, make the call, you want one more?

418
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,017
- [Akira] Yeah, do it.

419
00:12:51,017 --> 00:12:52,432
- [Jake] Hey!

420
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:53,630
- I don't know how many you're hanging on,

421
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:54,880
but it's not many.

422
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,757
All right, good luck!

423
00:12:55,757 --> 00:12:57,945
(upbeat synthesized music)

424
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,850
Here you go, follow me.

425
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,266
- How far back we going?

426
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:02,490
Are we going out here?

427
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,290
- If he doesn't catch
it, I cut another rope.

428
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,350
- You gotta catch it, you ready?

429
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,568
- Yeah sure, why not?

430
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:07,401
- yeet

431
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:09,240
(ball bouncing)

432
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,430
- So close.

433
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:13,880
- Marky Mark, Chandler
disappeared, so, you're in charge.

434
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,713
Here you go.

435
00:13:14,713 --> 00:13:15,546
- [Marcus] All right you ready Colby?

436
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:16,623
- Right here, at me.

437
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:18,700
- [Marcus] Oh!

438
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,150
- Two ropes it is.

439
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,890
- [Marcus] Oh my God, two ropes!

440
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,250
Red light me!

441
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,220
Here we go.
(ominous instrumental music)

442
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,042
One, two, three, four, five, six ropes.

443
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:28,560
(ominous instrumental tones)
(rope snapping)

444
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,620
Oh, now let's go to the other side.

445
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,162
Knife me.

446
00:13:32,162 --> 00:13:33,370
(ominous instrumental tones)
(chuckling)

447
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,800
Now there's four ropes,

448
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,340
should we just do one more on each side

449
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,620
and just get it done with?

450
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,820
Akira, do you agree?

451
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,823
- Yeah.
- Okay.

452
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,540
(grunting)
(gasping)

453
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,422
There are now three ropes remaining.

454
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:45,955
(upbeat electronic music)

455
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:47,814
- Win $7,000.

456
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:48,908
You know you gotta jump in the pool.

457
00:13:48,908 --> 00:13:50,170
(upbeat electronic music)

458
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,650
- You guys just don't budge.

459
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,483
What do you want me to do,

460
00:13:52,483 --> 00:13:53,765
just cut it down to one rope?

461
00:13:53,765 --> 00:13:55,185
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it?

462
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,018
- Yeah.

463
00:13:56,018 --> 00:13:57,610
- Let's ask our consultant, Cameron.

464
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,650
You were up there, you know how they feel,

465
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,080
should we go down to one rope?

466
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,240
- They've been up there quite
some time so I say yeah.

467
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,490
- Say no more, one rope.

468
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,370
Red lights.

469
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,770
Three ropes remain.
(ominous instrumental music)

470
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,600
I know you feel a difference now.

471
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,120
- Y'all feelin' that?
- Yeah.

472
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,770
- Okay, to the other side.

473
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,400
Still ten grand, anyone want it?

474
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,573
I'm trying to end your suffering
so we cut one over there.

475
00:14:19,573 --> 00:14:21,330
(rope springing)
(exclaiming)

476
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,650
One rope remains.

477
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,430
(upbeat electronic music)

478
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,310
There's officially one rope left.

479
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,610
We could cut the last rope
and do last fall into water.

480
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,200
- It'll be a shootout.
- But I'd only do it

481
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,420
if you both agreed to it.

482
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,570
You wanna do it Colby?

483
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:33,403
- Well we might as well get it over with.

484
00:14:33,403 --> 00:14:35,704
- So you're okay with me
cutting the final rope?

485
00:14:35,704 --> 00:14:36,958
- Oh my God!
- We're cutting

486
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,510
the final rope!

487
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,770
- We're about to cut the rope,

488
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,800
what's going through your mind?

489
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,473
- I'm just thinking about my
brothers, my family back home.

490
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:44,920
(sniffing)
- Aw.

491
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,753
I'm cheering for you.

492
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,170
So what's going through your mind Colby?

493
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,610
How long do you think you'll hang?

494
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,800
- Not very long, I'm a weak one so--

495
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,270
- Well you agreed to it, so we'll do it.

496
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,240
They both agreed to this, let it be known.

497
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,570
30-ish hours comes down to this.

498
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:59,630
Jake and Marcus are gonna
cut the rope on both sides

499
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,520
at the same time and whoever
can hang the longest wins.

500
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,110
Whoever loses will still get
ten grand 'cause why not?

501
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,680
Three, two, one, cut!

502
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,468
(suspenseful orchestral music)

503
00:15:09,468 --> 00:15:10,301
- Come on Colby!
- Come on!

504
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:12,099
- You got this!
- Pumped!

505
00:15:12,099 --> 00:15:13,734
(instrumental music intensifying)

506
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:16,376
(shouting)
(clapping)

507
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:18,641
- This could equal a million dollars.

508
00:15:18,641 --> 00:15:22,095
(shouting)
(splashing)

509
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,635
(exclaiming)
(shouting)

510
00:15:23,635 --> 00:15:27,193
(water splashing)
(cheering)

511
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,843
- I can't even move my legs.

512
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:32,100
- But you just won $10,000 though.

513
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,933
- Yeah.

514
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,900
- And here is our winner!

515
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,010
He's going on to compete
for one million dollars

516
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:38,960
in a few weeks.

517
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,500
If you want a chance
to compete against him,

518
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,710
make sure you follow me
on Instagram or buy merch.

519
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,543
Three more of these,

520
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,570
all twelve people in the
future three challenges,

521
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,040
will be people that follow
me on Instagram or buy merch.

522
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,230
You can face 'em, for one million dollars.

523
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,966
- Now this was for my brother.
(sniffing)

524
00:15:51,966 --> 00:15:52,895
- I think we should call him.

525
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:53,745
- [Host] Yeah, let's see what he says.

526
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,710
- I think we should call him.
- Guess what your brother did?

527
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,430
- Oh my gosh, please tell me he won?

528
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,400
- [Host] Yeah he did, he got the dub.

529
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,490
- Oh my goodness!

530
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,731
- I did it for you, bro 'cause I know,

531
00:16:02,731 --> 00:16:04,351
this means a lot to you

532
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,685
and I know you wish you
could have been here.

533
00:16:05,685 --> 00:16:07,594
(sniffing) So I hung
in there for you guys.

534
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:09,570
I know it's gonna make
our lives a lot better

535
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,390
if I can win that one mil.

536
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,538
I'm gonna do it for us though.

537
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:13,970
(sniffing) Love you.

538
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,190
- Dang, I'm crying now, ooh my goodness.

539
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,760
So we'll see you again in
a few weeks, later guys.

540
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,710
Also don't forget we're still
selecting for the next three

541
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,820
'Last to Leave' videos.

542
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,080
If you want to compete,
follow me on Instagram

543
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,250
or buy my merch.

544
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,480
Trust me guys, I care a lot
about you international people

545
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,850
but when trying to comply
with the laws in America

546
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,440
and other countries at the same time,

547
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,710
it's just hard, so sadly, this sweepstakes

548
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,410
is only U.S. based.

549
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,120
Also quick add in, we have a big problem

550
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,610
with people impersonating
me and I will only DM you

551
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,031
