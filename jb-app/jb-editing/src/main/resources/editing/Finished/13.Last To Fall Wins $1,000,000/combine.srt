1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,036
所以你不介意我割断最后一根绳子吧？
So you're okay with me cutting the final rope?

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:02,870
老天爷啊
Oh my god.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,603
我们要剪最后一根绳子！
We're cutting the final rope!

4
00:00:04,603 --> 00:00:07,436
三 二 一 剪！
Three, two, one, cut!

5
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:09,503
这可能相当于获得了$100万美元
This could equal a million dollars.

6
00:00:14,736 --> 00:00:15,836
感觉如何？
How's it feel?

7
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:16,670
有点吓人
It's kind of scary.

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,936
欢迎来到二号位（选手）
And welcome to the number two slot.

9
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:19,770
现在感觉如何？
How do you feel?

10
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,836
很好 我准备好赢了
I'm good, I'm ready to win.

11
00:00:20,836 --> 00:00:23,070
这比你想象的容易还是困难？
Is this easy or harder than you thought it would be?

12
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,036
我不会说 因为你们会让它变得更难
I'm not gonna say, cause y'all are gonna make it harder.

13
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:26,070
你感觉如何？
How do you feel?

14
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,836
老实说 吓尿了 我对高空有极大的恐惧
Freaking out, not gonna lie. I have huge fear of heights.

15
00:00:28,836 --> 00:00:33,736
你们中最后一个掉进这水里的人 将得到竞争$100万美元的机会
Last one of you guys to fall into this pool of water, gets the chance at one million dollars.

16
00:00:33,736 --> 00:00:34,836
不会吧！！
No way!

17
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:36,203
我的意思是这样的
And here's what I mean by that.

18
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,503
我们将有四个“最后离开挑战”的视频
We are going four last to leave videos

19
00:00:38,503 --> 00:00:43,670
每一个挑战的获胜者将在第五个视频中竞争$100万美元
and the winners of each will compete in a fifth video for one million dollars.

20
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:46,203
你现在正在观看本系列的第一部分
You are currently watching part one of this series.

21
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:47,936
我不在乎谁赢了 但不管谁赢了
I don't care who wins, but whoever does,

22
00:00:47,936 --> 00:00:52,336
都会在几周后飞回来与其他赢家争夺$100万美元
will fly back in a few weeks and compete against the other winners for a million dollars.

23
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:55,070
这可以说是我们做过的最极端的挑战
This is arguably the most extreme thing we've ever done.

24
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,036
看到这个笼子了吗？
See this cage?

25
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:58,903
我们从美国武士忍者（American Warrior Ninja）弄来的 就那个
We took it from American Warrior Ninja, that thing.

26
00:00:58,903 --> 00:01:01,070
我们放了一些绳子 还放了一些人在上面
We put some ropes and we put some people on it.

27
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,670
我们又拿了$100万美元 这就是为啥我们出现在这里
And we grabbed a million dollars and that's how we ended up here.

28
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,003
就像我说的 克里斯（Chris） 我们要做四个“最后离开挑战” 这是第一个
So as I said Chris, we're doing four last to leaves, this is the first one.

29
00:01:07,003 --> 00:01:10,303
而前四个挑战的获胜者将在第五个视频中参与争夺$100万美元的奖金
And the winners of all four compete in a fifth one for one million dollars.

30
00:01:10,303 --> 00:01:11,936
也就是说还有三个“最后离开挑战”视频
Which means there's three more.

31
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,470
那你要怎么挑选其他竞争人员？
So how you gonna pick all the other people?

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,303
很高兴你问了
I'm glad you asked.

33
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:15,136
这是如何
Here's how.

34
00:01:15,136 --> 00:01:19,103
如果你买了商品 或者在照片墙（Instagram）上关注我 你就会被邀请 就是这么简单
If you buy merch, or follow me on Instagram, you'll be entered. It's that simple.

35
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:21,270
我们会随机挑选在照片墙上关注我的人
We're gonna randomly pick people who follow me on Instagram

36
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,303
或者从现在到接下来的几次挑战中购买商品的人
or people who buy merch in between now and the next few challenges

37
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:25,970
我们将邀请他们参加比赛
and we're gonna invite'em down to compete.

38
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,770
我会在视频结尾提醒你们
And I'll remind you about that at the end of the video.

39
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,836
我们会给你们每个人一个教练
So we gave each of you guys a coach

40
00:01:29,836 --> 00:01:32,536
让他们每组穿同样的衬衫 这样观众就能分辨
and we made them wear the same shirt so the viewers could tell.

41
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:34,470
卡梅伦（Cameron） 你的教练是克里斯
Cameron, your coach is Chris.

43
00:01:36,503 --> 00:01:40,403
科尔比（Colby） 我们给你个钱德勒（Chandler）所以如果你想的话 现在就可以退出了
Colby, we brought you a Chandler, so you can just go ahead and just get out now if you want to.

44
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:42,603
不！不要这么说！
No! Don't say that!

45
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:44,670
还有你被分配到大个子维京
And you are assigned the big guy.

46
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,070
好了 你们每个人都有一个教练 他们会给你提供任何你需要的
So there you go, you each have a coach, they'll get you whatever you need.

47
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,770
最后一个倒下的人可以继续前进并争取$100万奖金 祝你们好运
Whoever falls last gets to move on and compete for one million dollars, good luck.

48
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:55,103
我想看看你在上面能不能给你弄瓶水 我们来试一试
I want to see if I can get you a bottle of water like up there, let's give it a shot.

-给你的香蕉！ -等一下 等一下
-A banana for you! -Wait, wait, wait.

54
00:02:09,736 --> 00:02:13,270
哇！他甚至都没有动！
Whoa! He didn't even move!

55
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:16,336
呃 额 呃 额 呃 额 呃 额
Uh, huh, uh, huh, huh, uh, huh.

56
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:18,236
克里斯 我们即将迎来我们的第一个挑战
So Chris, we're gonna do our first challenge.

57
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:21,703
在你们身后都有座位 你们可以争取坐着休息的时间来助自己取胜
There's seats behind you and you can earn time for sitting to help you win.

58
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:25,903
这个挑战的奖励是可以坐上休息一分钟 你得把这个鸡蛋扔给你的选手
The first challenge for one minute of sitting, you have to throw your contestant this egg,

59
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:29,336
他必须将其扔回去 并且没有裂痕 如果能完成 他就可以坐下一分钟
and he has to toss it back, without a crack. And if you do that, he can sit.

60
00:02:29,336 --> 00:02:33,503
-老兄 我从来就不擅长运动 -低手球
-Dude, I was never good at sports. -underhand.

61
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:35,103

00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,736
哦 我的上帝
Oh my God.

65
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,103
给你的鸡蛋
Here's an egg.

66
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:45,270
-好球！ -如果钱德勒抓到了你就可以坐下来
-Great shot! -And if Chandler catches this you get to sit.

67
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:47,870
唔 这就对了！

没有裂缝

69
00:02:48,803 --> 00:02:52,770
因此 既然他们完成了鸡蛋挑战 她就得到一点坐下休息的时间
So since they completed the egg challenge, she gets a little bit of sitting time.

70
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,836
给你的座位
There's your seat.

71
00:02:53,836 --> 00:02:55,903

你在帮助你的参赛手

在科尔比把时间快用光的时候 让我们看看你能不能给他争取一些
While Colby's wrapping up her sitting time, let's see if you can earn him some.

75
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,336

我会把座位放下来

科尔比 你的时间到了 起身 不要跌倒
So, Colby, your minute is up, stand up. Try not to fall.

80
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,570
现在我们收回她的座位
And now we will take her seat back.

81
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,436
杰克（Jake）的选手想要一些休息时间 所以我们给他一个椅子
And Jake's contestant wants some sitting time, so we give him his seat

82
00:03:19,436 --> 00:03:21,270

One final thing, if your contestant wins, they go on to compete for a million dollars.

为了激励大家帮助各自的玩家获胜
To incentivize you guys to help your players win,

86
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,436
如果他们赢得$100万美元 他们必须给你10％

That's $100 grand, and they still win $900 grand.

90
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,036
现在你们也要承担风险
Now that you guys also have money on the line,

91
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:46,436
让我们再做一次鸡蛋挑战 但要从更远的地方开始 这次奖励五分钟而不是一分钟
let's do the egg challenge again, but from further back. This time it's for five minutes instead of one.

92
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:51,003
不要越过这个 我们的奖金是$100万美金 而我们的标记是一袋薯片
Don't cross that, we have a million dollars on the line and our markers a bag of chips.

93
00:03:51,003 --> 00:03:54,736
这次只需要接住就行了 他就可以坐五分钟
This time we'll just do if he catches it. He can sit for five minutes.

101
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,303
哦 不！
Oh no!

102
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:16,403

体育 非我所长也
Sports, not good at 'em.

那现在谁认为自己领先一点？
So who thinks they're in first place right now?

106
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,736
老实说 我的意思就是我了

-你认为你是第一？-是的

00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,670
那是蓄意破坏 你必须绕着池子游十圈

Just consider it, I don't care who it is.

123

没人嘛 真的吗？
Nobody, really?

124
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:16,370
没有人想要独角兽的爱吗？
No one wants the unicorn of love?

125
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,362
很好 他们很固执 谁给我一把刀
All right, they're being stubborn, someone give me a knife.

126
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:20,136

Five of those twenty ropes are gone, how does it feel?

135
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,670
-感觉很不一样 -我不信你 我要剪掉更多
-There's a big difference but -I don't believe you, I'm cutting more.

136
00:05:48,036 --> 00:05:50,370
好了 把灯调回正常 我们没事了

139
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,203
我的锅！
My bad!

140
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:03,236
你们有十分钟的时间来画一幅参赛者的画像
You guys have ten minutes to draw a portrait of your contestant.

00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:02,433
你可不止这样 阿基拉
You can do better Akira.

276
00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:06,436
你有55秒的时间来决定 然后它回落到$7千美元
You have 55 seconds to decide, and then it falls back to seven grand.

277
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,936
他们有点过了 但那算是很多钱
That's pushing it, that's a lot.

278
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,070
你有40秒的时间赢$1万美金
You have 40 seconds to win ten grand.

279
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,192
你可能在$100万美元的回合中输掉并一无所获
You could just lose in the million dollar round and get nothing,

280
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:14,470
而此时此刻 你可以带着一万美元离开
when right now, you could walk away with ten grand.

281
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,070
$1万美金 我们等着就是这个
Ten grand, we were waiting on this.

282
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,117
阿基拉 你可以拿那$1万和你的双胞胎哥哥平分 他会很开心的
Akira, you could take that 10K and split it with your twin he's be happy with you.

283
00:12:20,136 --> 00:12:23,454
或者你可以为这$100万继续 并有可能赢得$100万美元
Or you can play for this million and potentially win a million dollars.

284
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,936
但我们加入就是要赢得
But we're in it to win it.

285
00:12:24,936 --> 00:12:26,170
是的！
Yeah!

286
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,570
五 四 三 二 我们来这就是来赢得
Five, four, three, two We came to win,

287
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,630
是的 阿基拉！我们来赢了！

288
00:12:32,636 --> 00:12:34,870
这是一个非常疲惫但坚定的人
That is a very tired but determined man.

289
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:35,903
我喜欢 阿基拉
I love that Akira.

290
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:37,970
现在还剩$7千 随时都可以拿走
Seven grand's still on the table, take it whenever.

291
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,470
剪绳时间！
Rope cutting time.

292
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,036
一旦我开始割绳子 你们其中一个就会掉下去
Once I start cutting some ropes, one of you are gonna fall.

293
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:45,070
-开始了！ -一根已断
-Here we go! -One down.

294
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:45,903
两根
That's two.

295
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,103
三根已断
Three down.

296
00:12:48,103 --> 00:12:49,970
阿基拉 你说的算 还要继续吗？
Akira, make the call, you want one more?

297
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,003
是的 继续吧
Yeah, do it.

298
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:52,403
嘿！
Hey!

299
00:12:52,403 --> 00:12:54,860
我不知道你踩了多少 但不多
I don't know how many you're hanging on, but it's not many.

300
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,736
好吧 祝你好运！
All right, good luck!

301
00:12:57,936 --> 00:12:59,836
给你 跟着我
Here you go, follow me.

302
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:01,236
我们要走多远？
How far back we going?

303
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:02,470
我们要出去吗？
Are we going out here?

304
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,270
如果他没抓住 我就再剪断一根绳子
If he doesn't catch it, I cut another rope.

305
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,336
你要接住它 准备好了吗?
You gotta catch it, you ready?

306
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:06,536
当然 为什么不呢？
Yeah sure, why not?

307
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:07,370
走起
yeet

308
00:13:09,236 --> 00:13:10,403
差一点
So close.

309
00:13:10,403 --> 00:13:14,672
小马库 钱德勒不见了 所以你来负责 给你
Marky Mark, Chandler disappeared, so, you're in charge. Here you go.

310
00:13:14,703 --> 00:13:15,536

Right here, at me.

312
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:18,670
哦！

313
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,136
两根要断
Two ropes it is.

314
00:13:20,136 --> 00:13:21,870
天哪 两根！

哦 现在我们去另一边
Oh, now let's go to the other side.

319
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,136
刀给我
Knife me.

320
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,603
现在有四根绳子了 我们应该在每边再剪一根 让它结束掉吗？
Now there's four ropes, should we just do one more on each side and just get it done with?

321
00:13:37,603 --> 00:13:38,803
阿基拉 你同意吗？
Akira, do you agree?

322
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:39,803
-是的 -好的
-Yeah. -Okay.

323
00:13:42,536 --> 00:13:44,403
现在剩下三根绳子了
There are now three ropes remaining.

324
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:49,039
赢得$7千 但你得跳进泳池
Win $7,000. You know you gotta jump in the pool.

325
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:51,636
你们就是不肯让步
You guys just don't budge.

326
00:13:51,636 --> 00:13:53,736
你想让我做什么 把它剪成一根绳子?
What do you want me to do, just cut it down to one rope?

327
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,170

是的
Yeah.

329
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,603
让我们问问我们的顾问 卡梅伦
Let's ask our consultant, Cameron.

330
00:13:57,603 --> 00:14:01,070
你在上面过 你知道他们的感受 我们应该剪的只剩下一根绳子吗？
You were up there, you know how they feel, should we go down to one rope?

331
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,236
他们已经在那里待了很长时间 所以我说是的
They've been up there quite some time so I say yeah.

332
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:04,470
别再说了 一根走起
Say no more, one rope.

333
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,370
红灯
Red lights.

334
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:07,770
剩下三根绳子
Three ropes remain.

335
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,570
我知道你现在感觉有所不同
I know you feel a difference now.

336
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,103
-你们都觉得吗？ -是的
-Y'all feelin' that? -Yeah.

337
00:14:12,103 --> 00:14:13,770
好的 到另一边
Okay, to the other side.

338
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:16,370
还是$1万美元 有人想要吗？
Still ten grand, anyone want it?

339
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,570
我想结束你的痛苦 所以我们在那里剪了一个
I'm trying to end your suffering so we cut one over there.

340
00:14:21,303 --> 00:14:22,636
只剩一根
One rope remains.

341
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:28,603
正式只剩下一根绳子了 我们可以割断最后一根绳子 然后最后一个落水的获胜
There's officially one rope left. We could cut the last rope and do last fall into water.

342
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:29,788
决胜之战
It'll be a shootout.

343
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:31,403
但是如果你们都同意的话我才会这么做
But I'd only do it if you both agreed to it.

344
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:32,570
你想做吗？科尔比
You wanna do it Colby?

345
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,084
好 我们还是结束吧
Well we might as well get it over with.

346
00:14:34,084 --> 00:14:35,703
所以我可以剪掉最后一根绳子吗？
So you're okay with me cutting the final rope?

347
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:38,503
-哦 我的上帝！ -我们要剪最后的绳子！
-Oh my God! -We're cutting the final rope!

348
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,770
我们要剪断绳子了 你现在在想什么？
We're about to cut the rope, what's going through your mind?

349
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,470
我只是在想我的兄弟 我的家人
I'm just thinking about my brothers, my family back home.

350
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,903
哇

351
00:14:44,903 --> 00:14:45,736

那么科尔比在想什么呢？
So what's going through your mind Colby?

353
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,603
你觉得你能撑多久?
How long do you think you'll hang?

354
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,770
没多久 我是较弱的一个 所以...
Not very long, I'm a weak one so...

355
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,236
无论如何你同意了 所以我们会剪的 他们都同意了 让大家知道
Well you agreed to it, so we'll do it. They both agreed to this, let it be known.

356
00:14:54,236 --> 00:14:56,570
30个小时的时间归结于此
30-ish hours comes down to this.

357
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,488
杰克和马库斯要同时剪断双方的绳索 谁撑得时间最长谁就是赢家
Jake and Marcus are gonna cut the rope on both sides at the same time and whoever can hang the longest wins.

358
00:15:02,503 --> 00:15:05,103
谁输了仍然会得到$1万美元 因为为啥不呢？（有钱任性）
Whoever loses will still get ten grand 'cause why not?

388
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:31,436
但是当你试图同时遵守美国和其他国家的法律时
but when trying to comply with the laws in America and other countries at the same time,

389
00:16:31,436 --> 00:16:35,403
这就变得很难 很遗憾 这种抽奖选择只在美国进行
it's just hard, so sadly, this sweepstakes is only U.S. based.

390
