1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,474
当前是1945年8月6日上午8:14，而你即将要经历地狱。
It's 8:14 am on August 6, 1945, and you’re about to live through hell.

2
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:10,019
但是此刻，辉煌，晴朗的一天才刚刚开始。
But for now, a brilliant, clear day is getting started.

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,691
经历了早交峰和拥挤的轨电，你便可以在宽敞，现代的办公楼
Morning traffic and crowded streetcars go by, and you arrive at work--a large, modern

4
00:00:14,899 --> 00:00:16,067
上班了。
office building.

5
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:20,739
早些时候，响起了一个空袭警报，但就目前来说响起警报已经很屡见不鲜了，
Earlier in the morning, there was an air raid alarm, but by now those are so common that

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:23,366
他们几乎就是在例行公事一般。
they hardly register as more than routine.

7
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:25,785
此外，解除警报也表明了这一点。
And besides, the all clear has come through.

8
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:29,998
只发现了几架飞机，意味着这可能不是轰炸。
Only a few planes were spotted, meaning this likely wasn't a bombing run.

9
00:00:29,998 --> 00:00:34,002
没有迹象表明今天会是非同寻常的一天。
There's no real reason to believe that this day would be any worse than the last.

10
00:00:34,002 --> 00:00:38,131
日本的其他城市，尤其是东京，受到炸弹的严重打击。
Other Japanese cities, notably Tokyo, have taken serious hits from bombing.

11
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:43,678
但是到目前为止，你的城市广岛还是比较幸运的，就像是被
But so far, your city, Hiroshima, has been comparatively fortunate--all but ignored by

12
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:45,680
美国的B-29轰炸机忽略了。
the American B-29s.

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,684
日本进行了十多年的全面战争以不同方式影响了日本的每个人。
The total warfare Japan has been waging for over a decade has affected everyone in the

14
00:00:49,684 --> 00:00:54,063
在年轻的时候，你就自己在国外服务过。
country in some way--when you were younger, you'd served overseas yourself.

15
00:00:54,063 --> 00:00:58,860
现在，这些年过去了，让人惊讶的是，你竟然能幸免于后方阵线的
Now, all these years later, it's almost surprising that you've been spared the worst tragedies

16
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,236
最糟糕的惨剧。
of the home front.

17
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:04,699
最重要的是，你祈祷战争会在你儿子年纪大到可以打仗，或者
Most of all, you pray that the war will end before your son is old enough to fight, or

18
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:06,409
女儿将要丧偶之前结束。
daughter to be widowed.

19
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:10,872
现在如其他的年轻人，他们一直忙于民防，
For now, like the other teenagers, they've been occupied with civilian defense, helping

20
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:15,835
在发生入侵时协助拆除旧建筑物，为军事战车腾出空间。
knock down old buildings to make way for military vehicles in the event of an invasion.

21
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:17,587
一分钟后：上午8:15。
A minute later: 8:15 am.

22
00:01:17,587 --> 00:01:19,964
你走进了办公楼的大厅。
You step into the lobby of the building.

23
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:21,674
然后世界都改变了。
And then the world changes.

24
00:01:21,674 --> 00:01:27,388
难以置信的黄光就像你被正在拍照的相机的闪光灯包围一样，
An incredible yellow light like the flash from a camera blazes all around you, and everything

25
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,724
你眼前的一切都是空白。
around you becomes an empty white.

26
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:34,187
你腾空了，你感受到碎片击中你，接着是震耳欲聋的
You're sent flying, and you feel pieces of debris strike you, followed by the deafening

27
00:01:34,187 --> 00:01:37,398
爆炸声响起。
boom as the sound from the explosion catches up.

28
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:43,780
你猛然摔倒在地板上并失去意识，有可能只是片刻，你也不确定。
You slam against the floor and lose consciousness–probably just for a moment, you're not sure.

29
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:45,615
你清楚你需要站起来。
You know you need to get up.

30
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:47,450
你伤到骨头了吗？
Did you break any bones?

31
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,369
没时间考虑这种情况。
No time to consider the situation.

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,081
大厅里没有其他人，但是所有家具和你自己
No one else is in the lobby with you, but all of the furniture has been blown to one

33
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:55,917
都被炸到了房间的一侧。
side of the room, along with your body.

34
00:01:55,917 --> 00:02:00,129
你支起自己，然后走出外面的门，门上也没有了上面的
You push yourself up and step back outside through the door that's now missing all of

35
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:01,714
玻璃。
its glass.

36
00:02:01,714 --> 00:02:05,051
你检查了自己周围，看看到底发生了什么。
You check all around yourself, and see what you're up against.

37
00:02:05,051 --> 00:02:09,055
在你面前是一堵火墙，它似乎正在增长。
In front of you is a wall of fire, and it seems to be growing.

38
00:02:09,055 --> 00:02:13,393
你转身向反方向跑，但是狂风在阻碍着你，玻璃和
You turn to run the other way, but now the wind is against you, and the glass shards

39
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:18,857
瓦砾碎片在你所感受到过的最强大的风暴中飞向大火。
and pieces of rubble fly back toward the blaze in the most powerful storm you've ever felt.

40
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:23,736
你躲回门口，看着任何可能着火的东西。
You duck back into the doorway and watch as anything that can catch fire, does.

41
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:27,198
就这样，你将不得不抗击如此巨大的风暴。
Somehow, you'll have to fight the tremendous windstorm.

42
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:31,619
在向前推进时，你会瞥见爆炸期间曾在屋外的人，
As you push forward, you catch glimpses of people who'd been outside during the blast,

43
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,454
有一些躺在街上，已经死了。
some lying dead in the street.

44
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:36,958
指尖是身体着火的第一部分。
The fingertips are the first part of the body to catch fire.

45
00:02:36,958 --> 00:02:39,627
在活着的人中，有些被严重烧死。
Among the living, some are horribly burned.

46
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:45,008
炽热的风将衣服粘带着皮肤，一条条的吹走。
The boiling wind blows strips of clothing off of them, along with strips of skin.

47
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:47,510
每个人都只是想远离火源。
Everyone just wants to get away from the fire.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,346
你感觉自己也可能会被烧死。
You feel like you might be getting burned yourself.

49
00:02:50,346 --> 00:02:52,015
你面前有条河。
There's the river in front of you.

50
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:56,185
随着一群人在后面向你施压，你跳入水中。
Along with the pack of people pressing against you, you jump into the water.

51
00:02:56,185 --> 00:03:00,565
当你浮出水面喘口气的时候，更多的碎屑像下雨一样落下。
When you rise above the surface to catch your breath, more debris rains down.

52
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:02,066
多少时间过去了？
How much time has passed?

53
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,610
还会有更多炸弹吗？
Are more bombs falling?

54
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,363
你听到一个孩子大喊大叫，然后帮助她越到河的另一边。
You hear a child yelling, and help her get across to the other side of the river.

55
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:11,868
还好没有更多的炸弹，尽管有四面八方的大火在燃烧，但是火球
There are no more bombs, and although there are fires burning in all directions, the fireball

56
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:14,746
停止扩张，空气也不是那么热了。
has stopped expanding, and the air isn't as hot.

57
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,040
你尝试帮助人们站起来。
You try to help people to their feet.

58
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,250
有些可以，有些则不能。
Some can manage, others can't.

59
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,880
一辆消防车到了，人们开始搀扶那些不能走上卡车的人。
A fire engine arrives, and the men start pulling anyone who can't walk onto the truck.

60
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,842
你会尽力提供帮助，然后和一小群幸免于难的人
You help as best you can, and then follow in the direction that the truck heads, along

61
00:03:27,842 --> 00:03:31,679
按照卡车行驶的方向前进。
with a small cohort of other people who've escaped the worst of the blast.

62
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:36,684
现在，当你徒步穿越成堆的砖块，混凝土和金属，
Now, as you trek through piles of bricks, concrete, and metal, making your way back

63
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:41,147
朝着你的房子前进时，云层变厚，大雨滴落下。
toward your house, the cloud cover thickens, and heavy drops of rain fall.

64
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,441
它们是黑色的，显然是辐射尘造成的。
They're black, apparently from soot.

65
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:47,820
对你来说，没有什么比先确定家人的安全更重要，但无论你
Nothing is as important to you as finding out if your family is safe, but neither you

66
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:52,700
还是其他的幸存者，在经过一个个被大火和浓烟包围，被夷为平地的建筑时，
nor the other survivors can ignore the calls for help as you pass block upon block of leveled

67
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:55,244
也不会忽略掉求助者的呼喊。
buildings amid the smoke and fire.

68
00:03:55,244 --> 00:04:00,041
数小时以来，你在推进时通过的浓烟和残骸，还有燃烧的房屋，
For hours, as you press northward through the smoke and wreckage, and burning houses,

69
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,877
你会听到有人被困在建筑下的哭声。
you hear the cries of people trapped below buildings.

70
00:04:02,877 --> 00:04:05,004
如果可能的话，你会从废墟中解救他们。
When you can, you free them from the debris.

71
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:07,090
还有的，你也无能为力。
Others, you're powerless to help.

72
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,969
你经过无数次的绊倒、爬行、匍匐或死亡。
You pass countless stumbling, crawling, prostrate, or dead.

73
00:04:10,969 --> 00:04:14,013
你掩饰你的罪恶感，并尽量避免看到最坏的情况。
You bury your guilt, and try not to see the worst.

74
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:17,725
你最大程度的确认你家附近的方向并向前推进。
You press forward in what you're fairly sure is the direction of your neighborhood.

75
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:21,688
一个小女孩在徘徊，抓着头上的伤口。
A little girl is wandering, clutching at a wound on her head.

76
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:26,109
你没法忽略她，抱着她走了一英里，直到你到达一个学校
You refuse to pass her by, and for a mile you carry her, until you reach a makeshift

77
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:31,197
内部的临时诊所，这里除了窗户外，基本上还完好无损。
clinic inside a school that, aside from its windows, is largely intact.

78
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:35,201
稍后，你将了解到你是离原子弹爆炸中心最近的人却没有
Later you'll learn that you were among the closest people to the atomic blast who didn't

79
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,202
死。
die.

80
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:40,123
你所在的建筑物使你免受爆炸和热浪的冲击。
The building you were in shielded you from the full force of the blast and heat.

81
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:44,377
半英里之内暴露于初始高温之下的任何人都不仅仅是
Anyone within a half mile who was exposed to the initial blast of heat didn't merely

82
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:47,672
烧死，而是瞬间被焚化。
burn to death: they were instantly incinerated.

83
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,968
在这个半径之外，还有成千上万的人被烧死，或者死于飞起的碎片和
Outside that radius, thousands more burned to death, or died from the flying debris and

84
00:04:51,968 --> 00:04:52,969
倒塌的建筑。
falling buildings.

85
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:57,181
在小学里，伤员已经肩并肩
Here in the elementary school, people are already stretched out shoulder-to-shoulder

86
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:58,182
躺在地上。
on the floor.

87
00:04:58,182 --> 00:05:02,437
一些护士在人与人之间争先恐后的清理着最严重的伤口，但显然
A few nurses scramble from person to person, cleaning the worst wounds, but apparently

88
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:05,189
已经没有足够的绷带给每个人。
already without enough bandages for everyone.

89
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:08,651
一些烧焦的身体显然已经停止了呼吸。
Some of the charred bodies have clearly already stopped breathing.

90
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,780
市内进行着所有紧急计划，在城市的各个区域
All of the emergency planning in the city, setting up emergency aid centers with supplies

91
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:17,452
建立备有物资的紧急援助中心，都会假设在此次攻击之后
in the various sectors of the city, had assumed there would actually be a city left after

92
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:18,703
是否还有这个城市存在。
an attack.

93
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:23,332
多数成年人痛苦难忍，但从孩子们的哭声中可以明显看出
Most of the adults are stoical in their suffering, but from the cries of children, it's clear

94
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,626
已经没什么止痛药了。
that there's little medicine for the pain.

95
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:30,214
当你扫描垫子上难以置信，不同程度损伤的身（尸）体时，但求希望不要看到
As you scan the unbelievable ranks of bodies on the mats, desperately hoping not to see

96
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:34,135
任何认识的人，你可以看到他们受伤的全部情况。
anyone familiar, you see the full extent of their injuries.

97
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:38,389
许多人被烧得如此惨烈，以至于你都无法想象他们会幸存下来。
Many are so badly burned you can't imagine that they'll survive.

98
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:42,518
显然，穿深色衣服比穿着白色衣服的人更容易
Apparently, people who were wearing dark colored clothing were sometimes burned more than those

99
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,813
被烧伤，因为吸收热量的差异。
wearing white, because of the difference in heat absorption.

100
00:05:46,022 --> 00:05:50,735
伴随着无法控制的解脱的泪水，你知道这里面没有自己的家人。
With uncontrollable tears of relief, you learn that no one in your own family is among them.

101
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:54,947
距离市中心三英里，你家的木屋被毁，
Three miles from miles from the center of the city, your family's wooden house was destroyed,

102
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,784
但尚未起火，至少现在还未起火。
but hadn't caught fire, at least not yet.

103
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:01,621
你感到恐惧，你意识到自己的妻子正在流血，背面和侧面都被玻璃碎片
You're frightened when you realize that your wife has been bleeding, cut down her back

104
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:06,167
割伤，但她向你保证，切口全伤在表面，
and sides by glass shards, but she assures you that the injuries are all on the surface,

105
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:10,088
她牵着你的手，找到你儿子和女儿，他们都在想方设法的
and takes you by the hand, to your son and daughter, both of whom are trying to administer

106
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:11,798
对伤者进行一些帮助。
some aid to the wounded.

107
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:15,927
没有实际的药膏了，不得不使用食用油来代替，
There's no actual ointment left, and they're making due with cooking oil, which is better

108
00:06:15,927 --> 00:06:19,430
尽管让人不安，但基于现在的情况，总比什么都没有好。
than nothing, albeit disturbing, given what's happened.

109
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,768
孩子们都遭受了擦伤和割伤，但是他们最大的痛苦就是等着你回来。
They've both suffered bruises and cuts, but their greatest pain was waiting for you to

110
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:24,769
回来吧。
return.

111
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:28,773
他们比较确信，因为你在市中心上班，你也一定没能幸存。
They'd been certain that since you were in the city center, you must have been killed.

112
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:32,235
但对你而言，你很高兴还能看着他们健康的
For your part, you're glad you've been able to keep your children healthy as they've

113
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,236
成长。
grown up.

114
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:36,864
随着配给的不足，诊所中的其他年轻人变得虚弱，
Other young people at the clinic have become weak as the rationing has gotten worse,

115
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:40,618
并且你会看到，在伤者中，营养不足将使他们生存的
and you can see that among the injured, malnutrition is going to

116
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:42,411
可能性要小得多。
make their chances of survival much less likely.

117
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,623
现在你已经找到了家人，你可以回去帮助救援。
Now that you've found your family, you can go back out and help with the rescue.

118
00:06:45,623 --> 00:06:50,128
除了持续的撤离队伍，你看不到有组织的协助，但是
You can't see much organized effort beyond the continuing lines of evacuees, but along

119
00:06:50,128 --> 00:06:54,382
与其他个体一起，你尽可能的帮助更多的伤员撤离。
with other individuals, you try to move as many of the injured as you can.

120
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:58,469
一些伤者卡在了河边的沙洲上，而你在涨潮之前将他们抬到
Some wounded people are stuck on a sandbar by the river, and you help to lift them to

121
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:00,888
更高的地面。
higher ground before the tide rises.

122
00:07:01,055 --> 00:07:05,726
这期间有一个特别惊悚的状况，伤者的身体从你的手中滑落，
In one particularly gruesome instance, the body of a victim slips from your hands as

123
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:08,604
因为烧伤的手臂皮肤过于松弛。
the burned skin of the arm tears loose.

124
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:13,192
又过几个小时后，你开始感到虚弱，然后回到援助站。
After several more hours, you begin feeling weak, and wander back to the aid station.

125
00:07:13,192 --> 00:07:17,071
当你到达那里时，你不禁意识到，不管骨头骨折与否，
By the time you get there, you realize that, broken bones or no,

126
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:21,367
你并没有毫发无损。你不可能只是精疲力尽。
you haven't escaped unharmed. It can't just be exhaustion catching up with you.

127
00:07:21,576 --> 00:07:25,913
你感到头晕目眩，感觉很无力，就像感染了流感一样。
You're lightheaded, and feel weak, like you've come down with the flu.

128
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,708
你坐在一张简易床上，只为了喘口气。
You sit down on a cot, just to catch your breath.

129
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:29,709
你感觉像是发烧了。
You feel feverish.

130
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,254
护士给了你一杯水，你很感激。
A nurse offers a cup of water, which you gratefully accept.

131
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:37,216
但当你将凉爽的液体倒在嘴唇上时，你却无法咽下去。
But as you pour the cool liquid past your lips, you can't swallow it.

132
00:07:37,258 --> 00:07:39,760
窘迫，你咳嗽然后吐出来。
Embarrassed, you cough and spit it out.

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,849
突然，你感到更糟，并且毫无犹豫地开始呕吐到地板上。
You feel much worse all of a sudden, and without hesitation begin to vomit on the floor.

134
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:47,435
有人把废纸篓放在你面前去接住呕吐物。
Someone puts a wastebasket next to you to catch it.

135
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:51,105
你不是首个出现这种症状的人，也不会单单一个人继续干呕
You weren't the first with this symptom, nor will you be alone as you continue to retch

136
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:53,900
并且连续几天腹泻下去。
and suffer diarrhea for days on end.

137
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:59,030
援助人员正在分发柔软的大米饼干和稀饭，但跟你一样，
Aid workers are distributing soft rice biscuits and bowls of rice porridge, but, like you,

138
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,073
很多人都没有食欲。
many people have little appetite.

139
00:08:01,073 --> 00:08:04,869
随着时间的流逝，虫类嗅探到幸存者身上坏死的组织。
As days pass, insects find the necrotic tissue on the survivors.

140
00:08:04,869 --> 00:08:08,956
受惊的家庭成员则会尽力清理有幼虫的伤口。
Horrified family members do their best to clear the wounds of larvae.

141
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,667
你感到尴尬去让你的妻子和孩子照顾你。
You're embarrassed to have your wife and children caring for you.

142
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:14,128
本应该是相反的方式。
It's supposed to be the other way around.

143
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:17,256
经过几天的痛苦，恶心感消退了。
After a couple of days of misery, the nausea subsides.

144
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,299
怎么不呢？
How could it not?

145
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:19,967
你好几天没吃饭了。
You haven't eaten in days.

146
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,138
这需要勇气，但你可以抿一小口水，然后喝一两口
It takes courage, but you're able to take tiny sips of water, and then a bite or two

147
00:08:24,138 --> 00:08:25,139
稀粥。
of porridge.

148
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,310
很少有时间和医生独处，但是从你无意听到的情况来看，你被侵入了一种
It's rare to get a moment with a doctor, but from what you can overhear, you've been hit

149
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,190
叫做γ（伽玛）射线的无形之力所引起的疾病，它可以直接
with sickness caused by an invisible kind of force called gamma rays that can fly right

150
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,609
穿过你的身体，撕开你的组织。
through your body, ripping tissues apart.

151
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:40,947
随着力量的恢复，你再次尝试使自己变得有用起来，去帮助完成
As your strength recovers, you again try to make yourself useful

152
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:42,615
无休止的重建工作。
aiding in the endless recovery work.

153
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:46,953
通常，这意味着帮助将尸体运送到火葬场。
Often that means helping to carry bodies to the perpetual funeral pyres.

154
00:08:46,953 --> 00:08:50,373
这些不幸者中的许多人从未与家人道别
Many of these unfortunates never got to say goodbye to their families, and their loved

155
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:53,876
他们的爱人也永远不会知道自己丈夫的遗骸变成了什么。
ones will never know what became of their remains.

156
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:57,129
对于某些伤者而言，辐射中毒更加严重。
For some victims, the poisoning from radiation was much worse.

157
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:02,718
接近24小时大关，有几个因大脑受损而变得语无伦次。
By the 24 hour mark, several had become incoherent from damage to the brain.

158
00:09:02,718 --> 00:09:06,472
有些人心跳加速，一些不久便心脏病发作。
Others had a racing heart; some soon suffered a heart attack.

159
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:10,309
一些则从实际上发生了颜色变化，变成了鲜红色，就像被晒伤一样。
Some literally changed color, turning bright red as if sunburned.

160
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:15,106
与你不同的是，受过辐射毒害，没有恢复食欲的人则在几天内就死了。
Those who, unlike you, never recovered their appetite, were dead in a few days.

161
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,484
但是随后，一些特别令人担忧的事情发生了。
But then something especially worrying begins.

162
00:09:18,484 --> 00:09:23,572
几个已经下床的人现在又平躺在床上，
Several people who had been up and about are now again lying flat on the cots, and they

163
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:24,949
他们看上去很不好。
don't look good.

164
00:09:24,949 --> 00:09:29,662
随着血管破裂，他们的皮肤变得斑驳，有紫色斑点。
Their skin has become mottled with purple blotches as blood vessels break.

165
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,539
他们会再次感到虚弱和不适。
Again they feel weak and sick.

166
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,210
痛苦看起来已经难以承受，但随后变得更加严重。
The pain already looks like too much to bear, but then it gets worse.

167
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,755
垂死的呕吐着鲜血，血液从他们的肛门中流出。
The dying vomit blood, and blood flows from their anus.

168
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,882
甚至眼睛也开始流血。
Even the eyes begin to bleed.

169
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:46,637
到目前为止，更多的医务人员已经从市郊和县外加入。
By now additional medical workers have come from the outskirts and outside the prefecture.

170
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:51,434
但是那些徘徊在死亡边缘的人往往会静脉萎缩，因此他们甚至无法注射
But those who hover over death tend to have shriveled veins, so they can't even receive

171
00:09:51,434 --> 00:09:52,601
吗啡。
morphine.

172
00:09:52,601 --> 00:09:55,646
你希望不要步入他们的后尘。
You hope that you're not due to follow their downward slide.

173
00:09:55,646 --> 00:09:59,900
医生会对你进行检查，并发现你身体上被忽视的斑点。
A doctor examines you, and notices spots on your body that you'd overlooked.

174
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,901
状况还是发生了。
It's happening.

175
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:05,072
但是至少现在你还没有感觉到，并且可以进行对话。
But at least for now you don't feel it, and you're able to carry on a conversation.

176
00:10:05,239 --> 00:10:07,074
医生来自东京。
The doctor has come from Tokyo.

177
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,454
他准是这种疾病的专家，尽管在广岛和
He must be an expert on this kind of disease, although before the bombing of Hiroshima

178
00:10:11,454 --> 00:10:14,040
长崎爆炸之前，只有极少数的病例。
and Nagasaki, there were very few cases

179
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,627
大多数科学家只是用镭或其他非寻常物质进行研究。
mostly scientists doing research with radium or other unusual substances.

180
00:10:18,627 --> 00:10:22,506
他确认核弹爆炸给你带来了有害的辐射。
He confirms that the atomic bomb blast dosed you with harmful radiation.

181
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:26,844
在这段对话，以及接下来的许多年中，你将热衷于了解辐射相关的
In that conversation, and many more that would follow over the years, you avidly learn details

182
00:10:26,844 --> 00:10:27,970
详细信息。
about radiation.

183
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:31,474
爆炸会发出了γ（伽马）射线，也发出X射线。
The blast did emit gamma rays, and X-rays as well.

184
00:10:31,474 --> 00:10:35,353
它们略有不同，但主要需知的是，在足够高的强度下，
They're slightly different, but the main thing to know is that in a high enough strength,

185
00:10:35,561 --> 00:10:40,191
它们都对你非常有害，不像医生使用的相对较弱的X射线
they're both very bad for you, unlike the relatively weak X-rays that doctors use to

186
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,193
用来给你的骨头呈像。
take pictures of your bones.

187
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:47,490
X射线和γ（伽马）射线都是由光子构成的，光子和普通光束是
Both X-rays and gamma rays are made of photons, the same kind of wave-particle as regular

188
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,574
同一种波粒子。
beams of light.

189
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:53,204
但就人们而言。它们的波长要短得多，
But they have a much shorter wavelength, and very different properties from visible light,

190
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:55,247
而且与可见光的特性大不相同。
as far as people are concerned.

191
00:10:55,247 --> 00:10:59,502
相比之下，一些从严重灼伤中恢复过来的人，
By comparison, some of the people who are recovering from serious burns to the skin

192
00:10:59,502 --> 00:11:04,465
同样也收到了非常大量的长波红外辐射
also received a very, very heavy amount of long wavelength, infrared radiation, which

193
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:07,968
会导致物质升温-但如果是短波辐射的情况，则是非常严重的。
causes matter to heat up--in this case, a great deal.

194
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:12,473
爆炸的温度是几千度-足以顷刻间使人
The temperature of the blast was thousands of degrees--enough to reduce people to dust

195
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,974
化成灰烬。
in an instant.

196
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:18,104
尽管γ（伽玛）射线不会引起表面灼伤，但它们是所谓电离辐射的
Although gamma rays don't cause surface burns, they're an example of what's called ionizing

197
00:11:18,104 --> 00:11:19,355
一个例子。
radiation.

198
00:11:19,355 --> 00:11:23,651
非电离辐射，例如无线电天线接收到的信号，
Non-ionizing radiation, like the signals that a radio antenna picks up, doesn't seem to

199
00:11:23,651 --> 00:11:27,363
在日常程度下似乎对活体组织没有太大影响。
have much effect of living tissue at everyday doses.

200
00:11:27,363 --> 00:11:30,241
但是电离辐射是另一回事。
But ionizing radiation is another story.

201
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:34,453
它的的名称正来自于其无形的作用，即导致分子内的原子失去电子，
This class gets its name from its invisible effect, which is to cause an atom to lose

202
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:38,332
留下带正电的阳离子（正原子核）。
electrons, leaving positively charged ions.

203
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:42,711
人体细胞内部是由电子结合在一起的复杂分子，并且
Inside the cells of your body are complex molecules held together by electrons, and

204
00:11:42,711 --> 00:11:46,465
如果足够多的分子被撕裂，细胞就会死亡。
if enough of the molecules are torn apart, the cell dies.

205
00:11:46,674 --> 00:11:50,928
当它发生在骨髓时，会尤其可怕，因为骨髓为身体
This is especially bad when it happens in bone marrow, which manufactures blood cells

206
00:11:50,928 --> 00:11:51,887
制造血液。
for the body.

207
00:11:51,887 --> 00:11:55,349
红细胞的缺乏会使人体缺氧。


208
00:11:55,349 --> 00:11:58,060
白细胞浓度低则使身体易受感染。


209
00:11:58,477 --> 00:12:03,482
血小板太少会阻止血液凝结，这会导致特征性斑点（淤斑、紫癜）


210
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:06,694
以及其他不良影响。


211
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:10,739
除了γ（伽玛）射线和X射线，还有一种称为β射线的电子流，
In addition to gamma and X-rays, there are streams of particles called beta rays, which

212
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,700
是松散的电子。
are loose electrons.

213
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:18,873
随着不稳定物质的衰变，由氦带电原子核和松散中子组成的α射线
Alpha rays, the charged nuclei of helium atoms, and loose neutrons, fly out of unstable elements

214
00:12:18,873 --> 00:12:19,874
会从这些不稳定元素中飞出。
as they decay.

215
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:25,087
几磅这种铀（放射性物质）元素就是广岛原子弹的核燃料。
A few pounds of one such element, uranium, was the fuel for the atom bomb at Hiroshima.

216
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:28,340
另一种是钚，驱动了长崎原子弹爆炸。
Another, plutonium, powered the blast at Nagasaki.

217
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,094
事实证明，这两种元素在产生核链式反应方面都非常有效。
Both elements proved terribly effective at creating a chain reaction.

218
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:36,640
而且，在任何时间段内没有保护措施的处理这些物质
Moreover, it's not safe to even handle much of these substances for any length of time

219
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,933
都是不安全的。
without protection.

220
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:42,146
玛丽·居里（居里夫人）发现了许多重要的放射性物质的特性
Marie Curie, who had discovered many of the important properties of radioactivity had

221
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:45,149
她自己后来死于辐射中毒（恶性白血病）。
herself later died of radiation poisoning.

222
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,237
因此，在核爆炸产生的烟雾和尘埃中，有大量放射性粒子
So amid the smoke and dust from the nuclear explosion was a mass of radioactive particles

223
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,031
吹向空中。
blasted into the air.

224
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:55,493
一些核物质在黑雨中掉了下来。
Some of that material fell right back down in the black rain.

225
00:12:55,493 --> 00:12:59,830
如果你的皮肤或衣服上有放射性物质，你会将其散布在周围。
If you have radioactive material on your skin or clothes you can spread it around.

226
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,877
更糟的是，如果你摄入放射性尘埃，它会在你的系统中停留一段时间，并且
Worse, if you ingest radioactive dust, it can stay in your system for some time, and

227
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:08,964
至少有一段时间，你的身体本身可能会发出辐射。
for awhile at least, your body could itself give off radiation.

228
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:13,427
想想你是怎么抱着你的妻子和孩子的，现在真希望你没有这么快
You think about how you held your wife and children, and now wish you hadn't found them

229
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:14,428
找到他们。
so quickly.

230
00:13:14,428 --> 00:13:18,349
由于爆炸离地面很高，市中心没有极点危险区。
Because the blast was so far above ground, there wouldn't be a dangerous concentration

231
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:22,186
混乱中的一点小安慰。
at the center--one small comfort in the chaos.

232
00:13:22,186 --> 00:13:24,605
数周以来，你的健康状况会下降。
For weeks, you do decline in health.

233
00:13:24,605 --> 00:13:26,857
你这次住进了真正的医院。
You're admitted to a real hospital this time.

234
00:13:26,857 --> 00:13:29,735
你的头发全部脱落，并且皮肤变得肿胀。
All your hair falls out, and your skin becomes swollen.

235
00:13:29,944 --> 00:13:31,946
恶心又回来了。
The nausea comes back.

236
00:13:31,946 --> 00:13:33,572
人们继续死亡。
People continue to die.

237
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,659
到9月，一些烧伤者的状况有所好转。
By September, some of the burn victims are in better shape.

238
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:41,205
你认为那些有严重烧伤且辐射中毒的人现在已经死了。
You assume that those with both heavy burns and radiation poisoning are dead by now.

239
00:13:41,205 --> 00:13:42,957
但是你还活着。
But you do not die.

240
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:47,127
这些年来，你的家人建立了新的生活，非常感谢你没有和
Over the years, your family builds a new life, utterly thankful that you didn't share the

241
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:51,131
两个被摧毁的城市中的超过20万的死者的命运一样。
fate of more than 200,000 in the two devastated cities.

242
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:54,718
你重新工作一段时间，然后退休。
You return to work for some time, and then retire on a pension.

243
00:13:54,718 --> 00:13:58,138
你的儿子和女儿都结婚了，并且都开始建立自己的家庭。
Your son and daughter both marry, and each begins to build their own family.

244
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:03,394
你了解到体内一种称为DNA的特殊化学物质，科学家所发现的
You learn about a special kind of chemical in the body called DNA, which scientists have

245
00:14:03,394 --> 00:14:07,731
它包含你体内所有细胞设计的蓝图，并与你爱人的DNA
found contains all the blueprints for the cells in your body, and that combines with

246
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:11,485
结合在一起，将在子宫内孕育一个新的生命。
the DNA from your spouse to build a new person in a woman's womb.

247
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:16,282
你还了解到DNA损伤会导致癌症，并且你知道癌症发生率
You also learn that it's damage to DNA that causes cancer, and you know that cancer rates

248
00:14:16,282 --> 00:14:19,368
对于受到过辐射的人来说尤其高。
are especially high for people exposed to radiation.

249
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:22,830
你比较担心自己的孩子。
You're not worried so much for yourself as for your children.

250
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,709
尽管他们可能没有表现出急性放射病，但他们肯定受到了γ（伽马）射线
Although they may not have displayed acute radiation sickness, they were certainly exposed

251
00:14:26,917 --> 00:14:28,210
的照射。
to gamma rays.

252
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,840
如果DNA受损，他们的孩子可能不会继承突变的基因吗？
And if DNA is damaged, might their children not have inherited the mutated genes?
