1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,490
It's 8:14 am on August 6, 1945, and you’re about to live through hell.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,060
But for now, a brilliant, clear day is getting started.

3
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,720
Morning traffic and crowded streetcars go by, and you arrive at work--a large, modern

4
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,109
office building.

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:20,739
Earlier in the morning, there was an air raid alarm, but by now those are so common that

6
00:00:20,739 --> 00:00:23,368
they hardly register as more than routine.

7
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:25,809
And besides, the all clear has come through.

8
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:30,038
Only a few planes were spotted, meaning this likely wasn't a bombing run.

9
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,030
There's no real reason to believe that this day would be any worse than the last.

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,169
Other Japanese cities, notably Tokyo, have taken serious hits from bombing.

11
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:43,689
But so far, your city, Hiroshima, has been comparatively fortunate--all but ignored by

12
00:00:43,689 --> 00:00:45,689
the American B-29s.

13
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:49,709
The total warfare Japan has been waging for over a decade has affected everyone in the

14
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,079
country in some way--when you were younger, you'd served overseas yourself.

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,899
Now, all these years later, it's almost surprising that you've been spared the worst tragedies

16
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:00,259
of the home front.

17
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:04,719
Most of all, you pray that the war will end before your son is old enough to fight, or

18
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,429
daughter to be widowed.

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,890
For now, like the other teenagers, they've been occupied with civilian defense, helping

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,859
knock down old buildings to make way for military vehicles in the event of an invasion.

21
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:17,599
A minute later: 8:15 am.

22
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:19,969
You step into the lobby of the building.

23
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,700
And then the world changes.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,400
An incredible yellow light like the flash from a camera blazes all around you, and everything

25
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,739
around you becomes an empty white.

26
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,228
You're sent flying, and you feel pieces of debris strike you, followed by the deafening

27
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,409
boom as the sound from the explosion catches up.

28
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:43,819
You slam against the floor and lose consciousness–probably just for a moment, you're not sure.

29
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,640
You know you need to get up.

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,478
Did you break any bones?

31
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:49,390
No time to consider the situation.

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,119
No one else is in the lobby with you, but all of the furniture has been blown to one

33
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:55,949
side of the room, along with your body.

34
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,149
You push yourself up and step back outside through the door that's now missing all of

35
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:01,750
its glass.

36
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,079
You check all around yourself, and see what you're up against.

37
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,090
In front of you is a wall of fire, and it seems to be growing.

38
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,430
You turn to run the other way, but now the wind is against you, and the glass shards

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,860
and pieces of rubble fly back toward the blaze in the most powerful storm you've ever felt.

40
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,740
You duck back into the doorway and watch as anything that can catch fire, does.

41
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,219
Somehow, you'll have to fight the tremendous windstorm.

42
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:31,650
As you push forward, you catch glimpses of people who'd been outside during the blast,

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,469
some lying dead in the street.

44
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:36,989
The fingertips are the first part of the body to catch fire.

45
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,629
Among the living, some are horribly burned.

46
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:45,009
The boiling wind blows strips of clothing off of them, along with strips of skin.

47
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,519
Everyone just wants to get away from the fire.

48
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,370
You feel like you might be getting burned yourself.

49
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,030
There's the river in front of you.

50
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,199
Along with the pack of people pressing against you, you jump into the water.

51
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,569
When you rise above the surface to catch your breath, more debris rains down.

52
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:02,068
How much time has passed?

53
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,629
Are more bombs falling?

54
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:07,389
You hear a child yelling, and help her get across to the other side of the river.

55
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:11,909
There are no more bombs, and although there are fires burning in all directions, the fireball

56
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:14,750
has stopped expanding, and the air isn't as hot.

57
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:17,050
You try to help people to their feet.

58
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,270
Some can manage, others can't.

59
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,909
A fire engine arrives, and the men start pulling anyone who can't walk onto the truck.

60
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,849
You help as best you can, and then follow in the direction that the truck heads, along

61
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:31,709
with a small cohort of other people who've escaped the worst of the blast.

62
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,689
Now, as you trek through piles of bricks, concrete, and metal, making your way back

63
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:41,189
toward your house, the cloud cover thickens, and heavy drops of rain fall.

64
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:43,469
They're black, apparently from soot.

65
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:47,859
Nothing is as important to you as finding out if your family is safe, but neither you

66
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,710
nor the other survivors can ignore the calls for help as you pass block upon block of leveled

67
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:55,259
buildings amid the smoke and fire.

68
00:03:55,259 --> 00:04:00,060
For hours, as you press northward through the smoke and wreckage, and burning houses,

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,900
you hear the cries of people trapped below buildings.

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,030
When you can, you free them from the debris.

71
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,098
Others, you're powerless to help.

72
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:10,988
You pass countless stumbling, crawling, prostrate, or dead.

73
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:14,030
You bury your guilt, and try not to see the worst.

74
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,759
You press forward in what you're fairly sure is the direction of your neighborhood.

75
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,689
A little girl is wandering, clutching at a wound on her head.

76
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:26,120
You refuse to pass her by, and for a mile you carry her, until you reach a makeshift

77
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,220
clinic inside a school that, aside from its windows, is largely intact.

78
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,240
Later you'll learn that you were among the closest people to the atomic blast who didn't

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
die.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,129
The building you were in shielded you from the full force of the blast and heat.

81
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:44,409
Anyone within a half mile who was exposed to the initial blast of heat didn't merely

82
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,699
burn to death: they were instantly incinerated.

83
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:52,000
Outside that radius, thousands more burned to death, or died from the flying debris and

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
falling buildings.

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,189
Here in the elementary school, people are already stretched out shoulder-to-shoulder

86
00:04:57,189 --> 00:04:58,189
on the floor.

87
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:02,439
A few nurses scramble from person to person, cleaning the worst wounds, but apparently

88
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,230
already without enough bandages for everyone.

89
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,680
Some of the charred bodies have clearly already stopped breathing.

90
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,810
All of the emergency planning in the city, setting up emergency aid centers with supplies

91
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,490
in the various sectors of the city, had assumed there would actually be a city left after

92
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,728
an attack.

93
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:23,339
Most of the adults are stoical in their suffering, but from the cries of children, it's clear

94
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,668
that there's little medicine for the pain.

95
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:30,221
As you scan the unbelievable ranks of bodies on the mats, desperately hoping not to see

96
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:34,160
anyone familiar, you see the full extent of their injuries.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,410
Many are so badly burned you can't imagine that they'll survive.

98
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,550
Apparently, people who were wearing dark colored clothing were sometimes burned more than those

99
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,829
wearing white, because of the difference in heat absorption.

100
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:50,739
With uncontrollable tears of relief, you learn that no one in your own family is among them.

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,978
Three miles from miles from the center of the city, your family's wooden house was destroyed,

102
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:57,800
but hadn't caught fire, at least not yet.

103
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,629
You're frightened when you realize that your wife has been bleeding, cut down her back

104
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:06,209
and sides by glass shards, but she assures you that the injuries are all on the surface,

105
00:06:06,209 --> 00:06:10,129
and takes you by the hand, to your son and daughter, both of whom are trying to administer

106
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:11,829
some aid to the wounded.

107
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,939
There's no actual ointment left, and they're making due with cooking oil, which is better

108
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,439
than nothing, albeit disturbing, given what's happened.

109
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,779
They've both suffered bruises and cuts, but their greatest pain was waiting for you to

110
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:24,779
return.

111
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:28,809
They'd been certain that since you were in the city center, you must have been killed.

112
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,269
For your part, you're glad you've been able to keep your children healthy as they've grown

113
00:06:32,269 --> 00:06:33,269
up.

114
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,899
Other young people at the clinic have become weak as the rationing has gotten worse, and

115
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,629
you can see that among the injured, malnutrition is going to make their chances of survival

116
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:42,439
much less likely.

117
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,629
Now that you've found your family, you can go back out and help with the rescue.

118
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:50,168
You can't see much organized effort beyond the continuing lines of evacuees, but along

119
00:06:50,168 --> 00:06:54,418
with other individuals, you try to move as many of the injured as you can.

120
00:06:54,418 --> 00:06:58,508
Some wounded people are stuck on a sandbar by the river, and you help to lift them to

121
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:00,889
higher ground before the tide rises.

122
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:05,758
In one particularly gruesome instance, the body of a victim slips from your hands as

123
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,629
the burned skin of the arm tears loose.

124
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:13,198
After several more hours, you begin feeling weak, and wander back to the aid station.

125
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,420
By the time you get there, you realize that, broken bones or no, you haven't escaped unharmed.

126
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,379
It can't just be exhaustion catching up with you.

127
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,930
You're lightheaded, and feel weak, like you've come down with the flu.

128
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:28,720
You sit down on a cot, just to catch your breath.

129
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,740
You feel feverish.

130
00:07:29,939 --> 00:07:33,279
A nurse offers a cup of water, which you gratefully accept.

131
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,258
But as you pour the cool liquid past your lips, you can't swallow it.

132
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,800
Embarrassed, you cough and spit it out.

133
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,889
You feel much worse all of a sudden, and without hesitation begin to vomit on the floor.

134
00:07:44,889 --> 00:07:47,439
Someone puts a wastebasket next to you to catch it.

135
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,110
You weren't the first with this symptom, nor will you be alone as you continue to retch

136
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,939
and suffer diarrhea for days on end.

137
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:59,050
Aid workers are distributing soft rice biscuits and bowls of rice porridge, but, like you,

138
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,079
many people have little appetite.

139
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:04,899
As days pass, insects find the necrotic tissue on the survivors.

140
00:08:04,899 --> 00:08:08,989
Horrified family members do their best to clear the wounds of larvae.

141
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,699
You're embarrassed to have your wife and children caring for you.

142
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,159
It's supposed to be the other way around.

143
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,290
After a couple of days of misery, the nausea subsides.

144
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,319
How could it not?

145
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,970
You haven't eaten in days.

146
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,139
It takes courage, but you're able to take tiny sips of water, and then a bite or two

147
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,168
of porridge.

148
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,319
It's rare to get a moment with a doctor, but from what you can overhear, you've been hit

149
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,218
with sickness caused by an invisible kind of force called gamma rays that can fly right

150
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,618
through your body, ripping tissues apart.

151
00:08:36,818 --> 00:08:40,968
As your strength recovers, you again try to make yourself useful aiding in the endless

152
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,639
recovery work.

153
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,989
Often that means helping to carry bodies to the perpetual funeral pyres.

154
00:08:46,989 --> 00:08:50,378
Many of these unfortunates never got to say goodbye to their families, and their loved

155
00:08:50,578 --> 00:08:53,878
ones will never know what became of their remains.

156
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,139
For some victims, the poisoning from radiation was much worse.

157
00:08:57,139 --> 00:09:02,739
By the 24 hour mark, several had become incoherent from damage to the brain.

158
00:09:02,739 --> 00:09:06,509
Others had a racing heart; some soon suffered a heart attack.

159
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:10,350
Some literally changed color, turning bright red as if sunburned.

160
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,118
Those who, unlike you, never recovered their appetite, were dead in a few days.

161
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:18,519
But then something especially worrying begins.

162
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,581
Several people who had been up and about are now again lying flat on the cots, and they

163
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:24,980
don't look good.

164
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,688
Their skin has become mottled with purple blotches as blood vessels break.

165
00:09:29,688 --> 00:09:31,568
Again they feel weak and sick.

166
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:36,248
The pain already looks like too much to bear, but then it gets worse.

167
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:39,778
The dying vomit blood, and blood flows from their anus.

168
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:41,889
Even the eyes begin to bleed.

169
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:46,669
By now additional medical workers have come from the outskirts and outside the prefecture.

170
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:51,458
But those who hover over death tend to have shriveled veins, so they can't even receive

171
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,609
morphine.

172
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:55,659
You hope that you're not due to follow their downward slide.

173
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:59,939
A doctor examines you, and notices spots on your body that you'd overlooked.

174
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
It's happening.

175
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,078
But at least for now you don't feel it, and you're able to carry on a conversation.

176
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,110
The doctor has come from Tokyo.

177
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,498
He must be an expert on this kind of disease, although before the bombing of Hiroshima and

178
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:17,019
Nagasaki, there were very few cases--mostly scientists doing research with radium or other

179
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,639
unusual substances.

180
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,539
He confirms that the atomic bomb blast dosed you with harmful radiation.

181
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:26,879
In that conversation, and many more that would follow over the years, you avidly learn details

182
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,008
about radiation.

183
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,508
The blast did emit gamma rays, and X-rays as well.

184
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:35,378
They're slightly different, but the main thing to know is that in a high enough strength,

185
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:40,219
they're both very bad for you, unlike the relatively weak X-rays that doctors use to

186
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,230
take pictures of your bones.

187
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,500
Both X-rays and gamma rays are made of photons, the same kind of wave-particle as regular

188
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,578
beams of light.

189
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:53,208
But they have a much shorter wavelength, and very different properties from visible light,

190
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,268
as far as people are concerned.

191
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,519
By comparison, some of the people who are recovering from serious burns to the skin

192
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,470
also received a very, very heavy amount of long wavelength, infrared radiation, which

193
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,998
causes matter to heat up--in this case, a great deal.

194
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:12,498
The temperature of the blast was thousands of degrees--enough to reduce people to dust

195
00:11:12,499 --> 00:11:13,999
in an instant.

196
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:18,139
Although gamma rays don't cause surface burns, they're an example of what's called ionizing

197
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:19,369
radiation.

198
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:23,678
Non-ionizing radiation, like the signals that a radio antenna picks up, doesn't seem to

199
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:27,379
have much effect of living tissue at everyday doses.

200
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:30,249
But ionizing radiation is another story.

201
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:34,480
This class gets its name from its invisible effect, which is to cause an atom to lose

202
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,339
electrons, leaving positively charged ions.

203
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,739
Inside the cells of your body are complex molecules held together by electrons, and

204
00:11:42,739 --> 00:11:46,498
if enough of the molecules are torn apart, the cell dies.

205
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:50,929
This is especially bad when it happens in bone marrow, which manufactures blood cells

206
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:51,929
for the body.

207
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:55,359
A deficiency of red blood cells deprives the body of oxygen.

208
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,318
Low white blood cell count leaves the body vulnerable to infection.

209
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:03,519
And too few platelets prevents blood from clotting, which causes the characteristic

210
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,730
blotches in addition to other ill effects.

211
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,758
In addition to gamma and X-rays, there are streams of particles called beta rays, which

212
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:12,739
are loose electrons.

213
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:18,899
Alpha rays, the charged nuclei of helium atoms, and loose neutrons, fly out of unstable elements

214
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:19,899
as they decay.

215
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:25,110
A few pounds of one such element, uranium, was the fuel for the atom bomb at Hiroshima.

216
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,379
Another, plutonium, powered the blast at Nagasaki.

217
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,118
Both elements proved terribly effective at creating a chain reaction.

218
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:36,679
Moreover, it's not safe to even handle much of these substances for any length of time

219
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,958
without protection.

220
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,188
Marie Curie, who had discovered many of the important properties of radioactivity had

221
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,179
herself later died of radiation poisoning.

222
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:50,239
So amid the smoke and dust from the nuclear explosion was a mass of radioactive particles

223
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,068
blasted into the air.

224
00:12:52,068 --> 00:12:55,528
Some of that material fell right back down in the black rain.

225
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:59,838
If you have radioactive material on your skin or clothes you can spread it around.

226
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,899
Worse, if you ingest radioactive dust, it can stay in your system for some time, and

227
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:08,970
for awhile at least, your body could itself give off radiation.

228
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,440
You think about how you held your wife and children, and now wish you hadn't found them

229
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,440
so quickly.

230
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,358
Because the blast was so far above ground, there wouldn't be a dangerous concentration

231
00:13:18,558 --> 00:13:22,208
at the center--one small comfort in the chaos.

232
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,618
For weeks, you do decline in health.

233
00:13:24,619 --> 00:13:26,859
You're admitted to a real hospital this time.

234
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:29,758
All your hair falls out, and your skin becomes swollen.

235
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:31,948
The nausea comes back.

236
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:33,578
People continue to die.

237
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,679
By September, some of the burn victims are in better shape.

238
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:41,238
You assume that those with both heavy burns and radiation poisoning are dead by now.

239
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,998
But you do not die.

240
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,149
Over the years, your family builds a new life, utterly thankful that you didn't share the

241
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,159
fate of more than 200,000 in the two devastated cities.

242
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:54,730
You return to work for some time, and then retire on a pension.

243
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,149
Your son and daughter both marry, and each begins to build their own family.

244
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,409
You learn about a special kind of chemical in the body called DNA, which scientists have

245
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:07,759
found contains all the blueprints for the cells in your body, and that combines with

246
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,500
the DNA from your spouse to build a new person in a woman's womb.

247
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,318
You also learn that it's damage to DNA that causes cancer, and you know that cancer rates

248
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:19,370
are especially high for people exposed to radiation.

249
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,860
You're not worried so much for yourself as for your children.

250
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,729
Although they may not have displayed acute radiation sickness, they were certainly exposed

251
00:14:26,929 --> 00:14:28,248
to gamma rays.

252
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:32,879
And if DNA is damaged, might their children not have inherited the mutated genes?

253
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,379
Certainly, some babies born soon after the bombing had a high rate of birth defects,

254
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:39,428
like underdeveloped brains.

255
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:44,838
So far, no one has seen any evidence of genetic damaged passed on to children of hibakusha--atom

256
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,998
bomb survivors--who weren't exposed in utero.

257
00:14:48,198 --> 00:14:52,659
You make sure that your children and theirs get check-ups from the doctor, and the new,

258
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:57,278
more peaceful Japanese government is keeping tabs on their health, and yours of course.

259
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,859
You can't help but notice that people in your new neighborhood in Tokyo don't want to stand

260
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:05,629
close to anyone in your family, and although their fears are unfounded, you can understand

261
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:08,479
their wariness in such strange times.

262
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,958
And you follow the arms race, as nations build nuclear weapons that could somehow inflict

263
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,599
far more damage than the one you experienced.

264
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,909
Years later, you take your grandchildren to see a movie you've heard about.

265
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:24,049
In this movie, there's a reptile whose body is altered by radiation, turning it into a

266
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,828
monster that destroys the city of Tokyo.

267
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:30,688
It's a bit of dramatic license, you know, but that's what movies are for.

268
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:35,469
The kids are old enough that they try not to seem scared, although clearly the fire-breathing

269
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,839
beast makes quite an impression on them.

270
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,558
The allegory in the movie is not lost on you, although you decide not to share it with these

271
00:15:42,558 --> 00:15:44,298
children of a new era.

272
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:48,668
They're aware of their country's bitter, foolish experience in making war, and the awful toll

273
00:15:48,668 --> 00:15:52,679
that their parents witnessed when men tested the limits of human suffering.

274
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,808
But you hope with all your heart that they will themselves only ever see such horror

275
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,149
in a movie.

276
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:03,818
This story is a composite sketch based upon the firsthand accounts of survivors of Hiroshima.

277
00:16:03,818 --> 00:16:08,938
Do you know anyone who’s had to deal with heavy radiation, either for work or for a

278
00:16:08,938 --> 00:16:13,009
medical treatment--or through exposure to hazardous material?
