1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,159
树。
Trees.

2
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:03,540
水果，香料和坚果的承载者。
Growers of fruits, spices and nuts.

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,540
荫凉的制造者。
Generators of shade.

4
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,718
鸟，松鼠，考拉的家园。
Home to birds, squirrels, koalas.

5
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:09,660
有前线士兵在应对气候变化？
Front line soldiers in the fight against climate change?

6
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,660
当然！
You bet!

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,699
今天我们讨论一些不一样的事，讨论一下teamtrees.org（植树分队）的使命：
Today we're doing something a little different and talking about teamtrees.org’s mission

8
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:20,390
到2020年种植2000万棵新树，每捐赠一美元等于
of planting twenty million new trees by 2020, where every donation of one dollar equals

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,390
种下一棵树。
one tree.

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,800
你可能会问自己“种植2000万棵新树对地球母亲
You might be asking yourself “what would planting twenty million new trees do for the

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
有什么好处？”
planet?”

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,670
先让我们看看每一次给teamtrees的捐赠会产生多大的影响！
Let’s take a look at just how huge an impact each donation to teamtrees will make!

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,960
从地衣到蜜蜂再到负鼠，各种各样的生物都把树当做家，只一棵
A wide variety of organisms from lichen to bees to possums call trees home, and just

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,539
成熟的橡树就可以容纳多达500种不同的物种！
one single mature oak tree can be home to as many as 500 different species!

15
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:45,038
地球正在迅速的失去物种—我们正处于大灭绝之中，如果没有
The earth is rapidly losing species--we’re in the middle of a mass extinction, and without

16
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:49,679
树木让他们回家，更多的动物将面临灭绝的危险。
trees for them to call home, many more animals will be at risk for extinction.

17
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,869
许多动物需要树木作为生活，觅食和提供保护的地方，所以只种一棵树
Many animals require trees as a place to live, to feed, and to provide protection, so planting

18
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:59,929
就相当于同时建造一座房子、饲养场和苗圃！
just one tree is like building a house, feeder, and nursery all at once!

19
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,900
捐出二十美元种二十棵树就相当于建造一整个动物城！
Donating twenty dollars to plant twenty trees is like building an entire animal city!

20
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,120
乘以一百万，那我们谈论的就是一个具有生物多样性动物
Multiply that by a million and we’re talking about a super metropolis of biodiverse animal

21
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,120
生活的超级大都市。
life.

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,760
一项又一项的研究表明，在一片树林或森林中度过一段时间
Study after study shows that spending time in a grove of trees or forest can provide

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,950
可以让人恢复情绪上的活力。
emotional rejuvenation.

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,750
它可以改善你的情绪，营造平和感，同时减少压力，沮丧
It can improve your mood, creating a sense of peace while reducing stress, depression

25
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:21,750
和愤怒。
and anger.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,840
日本人甚至对此有个说法：Shirin-yoku或“林中沐浴”。
The Japanese even have a word for this: Shirin-yoku, or ‘forest bathing’.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,760
树木的影响不仅是情感上的，而且是身体上的；研究表明
The effect of trees is not only emotional, but physical; studies have shown that being

28
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,310
在树木中生活不仅可以降低血压，还可以降低与压力有关的激素，
among trees reduces blood pressure as well as lessens stress-related hormones such as

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,829
如皮质醇和肾上腺素。
cortisol and adrenaline.

30
00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,829
因此，基本上就是说，树木可以使你快乐。
So basically, trees make you happy.

31
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:42,929
大量的科学研究表明，快乐的人犯罪较少，尤其是
Plenty of scientific research has shown that happier people commit less crimes, especially

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,930
暴力犯罪。
violent ones.

33
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,390
我们认为即使只有几棵树的树林也是不错的选择。
We think a grove of even just a few trees would be pretty nice.

34
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,739
2000万棵新树则可能意味着成千上万的新树林，这意味着数百万人能够
Twenty million new trees would mean potentially thousands of new groves, which means millions

35
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:56,459
定期在森林里沐浴，增加幸福感，减少犯罪。
of people able to take regular forest baths, increasing happiness and reducing crime.

36
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:58,359
你将成为一名常规的反犯罪斗士。
You'd be a regular crime fighter.

37
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,569
全靠你帮助种植的大树。
All thanks to the trees you helped plant.

38
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,029
树木通过阻挡阳光和遮荫来降低空气温度。
Trees reduce air temperature through blocking sunlight and creating shade.

39
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,609
也通过从叶子向上反射热量来帮助降温。
Trees also help to cool by reflecting heat upwards from their leaves.

40
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:11,699
当水分从叶子表面蒸发时，会进一步冷却，就像
Further cooling occurs when moisture evaporates from the surface of leaves, just like the

41
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,969
你的身体通过出汗降温一样。
way your body cools down by sweating.

42
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:16,090
树木可大幅度降温一块区域。
Trees can cool down an area by a lot.

43
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,479
这可不只有几度的单位，有成熟树林的城区在夏季的高温下，
And we’re not talking about just a couple of degrees, urban neighborhoods with mature

44
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:25,239
比没有树木的城区要凉爽11度。
trees can be up to 11 degrees cooler in summer heat than neighborhoods without trees.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,780
想一想90度（32摄氏度）酷热的一天和79度（26摄氏度）温暖舒适的一天
Just think about the difference between a miserably hot 90 degree day and a warm, comfortable

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,419
有什么不同。
79 degrees.

47
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:35,639
树木还可以使建筑降温，从而限制了对空调的需求，
Trees can also cool down buildings, limiting the need for air conditioning which has the

48
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:38,289
而空调又有助于节约能源。
added benefit of helping to conserve energy.

49
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:42,099
研究表明，精心种植的树荫可以减少20%到30%的
Studies have shown that shade from strategically planted trees can reduce the air conditioning

50
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,489
建筑空调的成本。
costs of buildings by 20% to 30%.

51
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,939
试想一下，如果一个普通的家庭在夏天每个月有大约100美元的制冷费，
Just think, if an average home has a cooling power bill of around $100 per month in the

52
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:55,270
如果在同一栋房子周围种上10棵树，那么可以节省30%的电费，
summer, and if ten trees were planted around that same house then 30% could be saved, then

53
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,900
这意味着在房子周围种上2000万棵树可以节省600万美元的能源成本！
that means 20,000,000 trees planted around homes could save $60,000,000 in energy costs!

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,790
所以，如果你不能为这个特殊的原因捐款，请考虑在你的房子
So if you can’t donate to this particular cause, please consider planting a few new

55
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,409
周围种几棵新树。
trees around your house.

56
00:03:06,409 --> 00:03:10,189
他们不仅会是一个美丽的附加物，甚至可能节省未来自己
Not only will they be a beautiful addition, but they might even save your future self

57
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,000
电费单上的一些钱。
some money on your power bill.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,800
树木是理想的隔音材料，因为它们可以通过两种方式减少声音：首先，
Trees are ideal for use as sound barriers because they reduce sound in two ways: First,

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,189
它们吸收声音，因为茂密的树枝和树叶很容易吸收
they absorb sound since thick branches and leaves are great at absorbing high

60
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:22,189
高频噪音。
frequency noise.

61
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:23,550
其次，树木使声音发生偏转。
Secondly, trees deflect sound.

62
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,280
当声音击中刚性材料时，它会弹回。
When a sound hits rigid material it bounces back.

63
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,639
当声音撞击树枝等柔性材料时，材料振动，
When a sound hits flexible material such as branches, the material vibrates and the sound

64
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,708
声音转变成其他形式的能量。
is transformed into other forms of energy.

65
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,360
一排浓厚的树木可以阻挡多达15分贝的声音，这就像是
A thick row of trees can block as much as fifteen decibels of sound, that’s almost

66
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,460
戴着一副耳塞，但你可以看到一些美丽的绿茵，而不是
like wearing a pair of ear plugs but you have something beautiful to look at instead of

67
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,650
耳朵里嗝耳的泡沫。
uncomfortable foam in your ears.

68
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:48,189
树木的根系在暴雨期间巩固土壤，防止侵蚀、洪水和泥石流，。
The root systems of trees hold soil in place during heavy rainstorms preventing erosion,

69
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:51,469
保护人和建筑物的安全
flooding and mudslides, keeping people and buildings safe.

70
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:55,430
树木也能改善水质，因为它们的根系有助于过滤杂质和
Trees improve water quality too; as their root systems help to filter impurities and

71
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,280
保持土壤中的水分。
retain water in the soil.

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,800
这样就可以对地下水位进行补给，最终排入下水道的水更少，
This allows for water tables to be recharged, with less water ultimately ending up in sewers,

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,370
并减少了将污染物带入海洋的降雨量。
and diminishing the amount of stormwater carrying pollutants to the ocean.

74
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,110
一棵100英尺高的树在生长季节可以从土壤中吸收11000加仑的水，
A single 100 foot tall tree can take as much as 11,000 gallons of water out of the soil

75
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,180
释放出健康的氧气和清洁的水蒸气。
during its growing season, releasing the water as healthy oxygen and clean water vapor.

76
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,949
这意味着2000万棵树可以过滤掉惊人的2200亿加仑水！
That means twenty million trees could filter a staggering 220 billion gallons!

77
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:24,990
这足以容纳超过30万个奥林匹克游泳池！
That’s enough to fill more than 300,000 Olympic swimming pools!

78
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,819
人类吸入氧气并呼出二氧化碳；树木则正好相反，它在光合作用过程中吸收和储存二氧化碳，
Humans inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide; trees do exactly the opposite by absorbing

79
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:37,250
产生并释放氧气作为副产品。
and storing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis which produces and releases oxygen as a by-product.

80
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,750
过量的二氧化碳正在我们的大气中堆积，从而增强了温室效应，
Excess carbon dioxide is building up in our atmosphere, strengthening the greenhouse effect,

81
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,410
并加剧了全球变暖。
and contributing to global warming.

82
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,509
地球上树木越多，吸收和减少的二氧化碳就越多。
The more trees the earth has, the more carbon dioxide is absorbed and mitigated.

83
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:52,099
树木产生的氧气量取决于几个因素，
The amount of oxygen produced by a tree depends on several factors, including the species

84
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,850
包括树种、健康状况和环境温度。
of tree, its health, and the ambient temperature.

85
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:00,120
但是，一些典型的计算是，一棵成熟的树每年可以吸收48磅（21.77公斤）的二氧化碳
However some typical calculations are that a single mature tree can absorb carbon dioxide

86
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,160
并释放足够的氧气回到大气中，
at a rate of 48 pounds (21.77 kg) per year and release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere

87
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,870
以支持两个人。
to support two humans.

88
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,709
每年一英亩的树木消耗同样数量的二氧化碳，相当于
One acre of trees annually consumes the same amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to driving

89
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,769
平均行驶26000英里（41842公里）的汽车。
an average car for 26,000 miles (41,842 km).

90
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:18,769
如果我们假设一英亩有大约300棵树，那么二千万棵新树可以
If we assume that an acre has roughly 300 trees, then twenty million new trees could

91
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:24,889
消耗一辆每年行驶超过17亿英里的汽车的二氧化碳当量。
consume the carbon dioxide equivalent of a car driving over 1.7 BILLION miles annually!

92
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:29,860
最后要说的是，除了二氧化碳，树木还吸收其他潜在
Last but not least, in addition to carbon dioxide, trees absorb other potentially harmful

93
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,189
有害污染物，如二氧化硫和一氧化碳。
pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide.

94
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:37,990
树冠起到物理过滤的作用，捕捉灰尘、花粉、
The canopies of trees act as a physical filter, trapping particulates of dust, pollen,

95
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,990
烟雾和微粒。
smoke and smog.

96
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,500
一棵成熟的树每年可以移除高达2.20磅（1.7公斤）的重量，这意味着2000万棵树
A single mature tree removes up to 2.20 pounds (1.7 kg) every year, which means twenty million

97
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,329
可以移除高达4400万磅重量的污染物。
could remove up to 44 million pounds.

98
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:51,659
不仅如此，研究还表明，与迎风面相比，
And that’s not all, studies have also shown that the dust level in the air can be as much

99
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,718
树的遮风面空气中的粉尘含量可以降低75%。
as 75% lower on the sheltered side of the tree as compared to the windward side.

100
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,029
没人，我们的意思是，没有一个人喜欢空气中的灰尘。
No one, and we mean no one, likes dust in the air.

101
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:04,388
所以，帮你和你的邻居一个忙，种些树，或者给teamtrees
So do yourself and your neighbors a favor and plant some trees, or donate a few dollars

102
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,519
捐点钱，为你自己和子孙后代净化一下空气。
to teamtrees.org and clean the air for yourself and generations to come.

103
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,448
2019年7月，瑞士的一项研究表明，如果种植了足够的树木，我们就可以阻止气候变化，
In July of 2019 a Swiss study stated that if we plant enough trees we can stop, or at

104
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,470
或者说至少可以严重遏制气候变化。这也是为什么我们致力于帮助
least put a serious dent in climate change, which is why we’re committed to helping

105
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,750
teamtrees完成它的的使命，即到2020年种植2000万棵新树。
teamtrees.org mission to plant 20 million new trees by 2020.

106
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,279
【事图秀】正在参与，你也应该参与！
The Infographics Show is getting involved and you should too!

107
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,793
每捐赠1美元就等于种下了一棵新树，因此要成为这个
Every donation of $1 equals a new tree planted, so become part of something huge 

108
00:06:30,793 --> 00:06:36,426
巨大公益的一部分，向世界展示YouTube社区能够团结起来，做一些
with real benefits, and show the world that the Youtube community can come together 

109
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:37,689
不可思议的事。
and do something incredible.

110
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,329
你还在等什么？
So what are you waiting for?
