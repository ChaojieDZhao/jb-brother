1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,910
In this day and age, we've all become pretty much dependent on the internet.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:08,199
We use it to connect with friends and family, to figure out where we're going, to purchase

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:12,399
things, and some of us are even dependent on it to get to work and school with apps

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,689
like Uber and Lyft.

5
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:18,649
But what would happen if the entire internet suddenly shut down?

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,089
Long story short - It would be chaos!

7
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:25,530
The stock market would shut down, we wouldn't be able to access our banks or pay with our

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,359
cards, GPS would stop working, and you wouldn't be able to watch any great YouTube videos

9
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:31,998
(like this one).

10
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:36,109
Thankfully, outside of the occasional Wi-Fi outage, most of us haven't had to experience

11
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,350
anything like this.

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,959
However, thanks to the accidental handiwork of just one man, an entire country once went

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,259
through that exact disaster-level situation.

14
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:46,479
So who was this man?

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,029
How did he knock out an entire country's internet connection?

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,850
And what happened as a result?

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,669
Let's dive right in to find out.

18
00:00:53,869 --> 00:00:58,439
Back in November of 2016, a man named Daniel Kaye was approached by an employee of the

19
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:03,629
Liberian cell phone and internet provider Cellcom with a very interesting offer.

20
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:09,120
$10,000 a month for Kaye to do as much damage as humanly possible to Cellcom's main rival,

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,250
Lonestar's, service and reputation.

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,629
So why would Daniel Kaye be approached for such a huge job?

23
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:19,679
Well, Kaye, a then 28-year-old British man originally from the city of Egham, was a completely

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,509
self-taught hacker who had begun offering illicit hacking services.

25
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,719
The Cellcom employee, likely hoping to take as many customers from their large rival as

26
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,000
possible, sought out Kaye's help through the elusive dark web.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,310
Over the next few weeks, Daniel Kaye began planning his hack.

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:39,180
He decided he would use a tried and true hacking method that had been used for decades in thousands

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,679
of attacks: DDOS.

30
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,219
DDOS standing for Distributed Denial of Service.

31
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,349
Basically, it means that a hacker sends so many requests to enter a server at once, that

32
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,419
the server can't handle them all and crashes.

33
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,810
The same type of this can accidentally happen when a company releases brand new, limited

34
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,590
edition merchandise, or when highly sought-after concert tickets go on sale and millions of

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,539
people try to log onto a site at once.

36
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:06,079
In order to launch this attack on Lonestar in Liberia, Kaye had an elaborate plan in

37
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,079
mind.

38
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,789
He had found that the Chinese-made Dahua brand security cameras, ironically enough, themselves

39
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,590
had a security weakness that could be exploited.

40
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,590
Not sure if I'd trust that company to keep me safe any time soon.

41
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,299
Using a string of code and commands known as "Mirai #14"� basically some hacking mumbo

42
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:24,968
jumbo, Kaye took control of the web-connected cameras, and on November 3rd, 2016, sent them

43
00:02:24,968 --> 00:02:28,628
all to simultaneously try and access Lonestar's servers.

44
00:02:28,628 --> 00:02:32,219
Now, there's something you should know about the internet connection in Liberia at the

45
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,219
time.

46
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:36,870
There were a very limited number of internet and cell phone service providers back then,

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,688
so most of the traffic in the country went through either Lonestar or Cellcom networks,

48
00:02:40,688 --> 00:02:45,180
and alongside having a very limited Atlantic Cable connection, this meant that an attack

49
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,310
on Lonestar could mean that all the requests for internet moving through Liberia wouldn't

50
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,769
have any way to be completed.

51
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,341
As soon as the Dahua cameras started being used to overwhelm the Lonestar network, it

52
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,899
began to struggle, and in some places even shut down.

53
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:04,108
However Kaye didn't think he had enough firepower, so he attempted to also create some more DDoS

54
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:08,299
bots by exploiting another security flaw in the national infrastructure of cell towers

55
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,590
in Germany, set up by Deutsche Telekom.

56
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,558
At this point, Lonestar called in cyber security experts, but it was too late.

57
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:17,989
The hack had already gotten out of control.

58
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,009
Due to the fact that a large portion of Liberia's internet traffic was dependent on infrastructure

59
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:27,799
set up by Lonestar, for the next two days, while Lonestar was under attack, internet

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,109
users across the country found that they were unable to make phone calls or even access

61
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:33,308
the internet.

62
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:38,878
Without even meaning to, Daniel Kaye had knocked out an entire country's internet connection.

63
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:43,348
This was the first time anyone had managed to do this in history, and it was entirely

64
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,479
by accident.

65
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:49,899
In February of 2017, following an investigation, Kaye was arrested under suspicion of having

66
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,530
committed the major hack.

67
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:55,560
Following his arrest, Kaye was extradited to Germany to face charges there as well,

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,968
as during his attempt to use resources from the Deutsche Telekom network he had also succeeded

69
00:03:59,968 --> 00:04:05,188
in knocking out the internet connection of more than 124,000 of their customers.

70
00:04:05,188 --> 00:04:08,609
There too, he pled guilty to the charges, although they were far less severe than the

71
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,810
ones he faced when he returned to the UK.

72
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:14,998
Once Germany sent Kaye back to his homeland, he pled guilty to crimes under the Computer

73
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:20,548
Misuse Act of 1990 under UK law, as well as possession of criminal property, namely the

74
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:23,769
10,000 dollars he had received in order to do all of this.

75
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:27,349
During the investigation, it was discovered that at the peak of the hack, Kaye had been

76
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,750
in control of over 1 million devices worldwide, all from the comfort of a vacation home in

77
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,500
Cyprus he had been staying at.

78
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,728
The effects of Kaye's hack on Lonestar, and Liberia as a whole, were incredibly far reaching.

79
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:44,240
He had made it so that all of Lonestar's customers, and really most people across Liberia, were

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,719
totally unable to communicate with each other or access basic services.

81
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,379
As a result of the hack, a substantial number of these customers switched to Lonestar's

82
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:57,240
competitors, including Cellcom, who at the end of the day, still got what they wanted.

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,720
Daniel Kaye was sentenced to serve 32 months in jail, a small price to pay for the incredible

84
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,838
damage he caused to the nation of Liberia.

85
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:08,550
In fact, Kaye may have even gained some benefits from his arrest, as his lawyer has stated

86
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,509
that since the attack, several major tech companies have reached out to Kaye, wanting

87
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,639
to recruit him to use his powers for good instead of evil.

88
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,199
So what would you do if the internet suddenly went out in your entire country?

89
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,129
Let us know down in the comments.

90
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:26,129
Thanks for watching!
