1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,882
在这个时代，我们所有人都非常依赖互联网。
In this day and age, we've all become pretty much dependent on the internet.

2
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:08,182
我们通过互联网使用APP与朋友和家人聊天，导航去处，网上购物，
We use it to connect with friends and family, to figure out where we're going, to purchase

3
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:12,382
更有甚者依赖它进行工作和就学。
things, and some of us are even dependent on it to get to work and school with apps.

4
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:13,682
例如Uber和Lyft。
like Uber and Lyft.

5
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:18,649
但是，如果整个互联网突然关闭的话会发生什么？
But what would happen if the entire internet suddenly shut down?

6
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,082
长话短说，产生混乱！
Long story short - It would be chaos!

7
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:25,515
股市将会关闭，我们将无法访问银行或使用银行卡付款，
The stock market would shut down, we wouldn't be able to access our banks or pay with our

8
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:30,349
GPS导航系统将停止工作，并且你也无法观看任何优秀的B站视频
cards, GPS would stop working, and you wouldn't be able to watch any great YouTube videos

9
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,982
就像这个。
like this one.

10
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:36,082
幸运的是，在偶发性WiFi中断的情况，我们大多数人都不必拥有
Thankfully, outside of the occasional Wi-Fi outage, most of us haven't had to experience

11
00:00:36,082 --> 00:00:37,349
如此的经历。
anything like this.

12
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:41,949
但是，由于某一个人的无意所为，一整个国家曾经体验过
However, thanks to the accidental handiwork of just one man, an entire country once went

13
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,249
上述水平的灾难状况。
through that exact disaster-level situation.

14
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:46,449
那这个男人是谁？
So who was this man?

15
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:50,015
他是如何切断整个国家的互联网连接的？
How did he knock out an entire country's internet connection?

16
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,849
造成的结果是什么？
And what happened as a result?

17
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:53,649
让我们来深入了解一下。
Let's dive right in to find out.

18
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:58,415
早在2016年11月，利比里亚的手机和互联网提供商Cellcom的一名员工向
Back in November of 2016, a man named Daniel Kaye was approached by an employee of the

19
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:03,615
一位名叫丹尼尔凯伊（Daniel Kaye）的男子提出了一个很有吸引力的提议。
Liberian cell phone and internet provider Cellcom with a very interesting offer.

20
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:09,115
每月付10,000美元让凯伊尽可能地对Cellcom的主要竞争对手Lonestar的服务和
$10,000 a month for Kaye to do as much damage as humanly possible to Cellcom's main rival,

21
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,249
声誉造成损害。
Lonestar's, service and reputation.

22
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:14,615
那么，为什么丹尼尔凯伊会得到如此庞大的工作呢？
So why would Daniel Kaye be approached for such a huge job?

23
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:19,649
凯伊，一个28岁的英国人，来自埃格姆（Egham, ）市，是一个完全
Well, Kaye, a then 28-year-old British man originally from the city of Egham, was a completely

24
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:23,482
自学成才的黑客，并开始提供非法的黑客入侵服务。
self-taught hacker who had begun offering illicit hacking services.

25
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:27,715
这位Cellcom的员工可能希望从他们的最大竞争对手那里争取尽可能多的客户，
The Cellcom employee, likely hoping to take as many customers from their large rival as

26
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:30,982
于是通过风谲云诡的暗网寻求凯伊的帮助。
possible, sought out Kaye's help through the elusive dark web.

27
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:34,282
在接下来的几周中，丹尼尔凯伊开始规划他的黑客活动。
Over the next few weeks, Daniel Kaye began planning his hack.

28
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:39,149
他决定使用一种久经考验的入侵方法，这种方法已经在数千次攻击中
He decided he would use a tried and true hacking method that had been used for decades

29
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:40,649
使用了数十年：DDOS。
in thousands of attacks: DDOS.

30
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,215
DDOS代表分布式拒绝服务。
DDOS standing for Distributed Denial of Service.

31
00:01:44,215 --> 00:01:48,349
基本上就是黑客同时发送大量的客户端请求访问服务器，
Basically, it means that a hacker sends so many requests to enter a server at once, that

32
00:01:48,349 --> 00:01:50,415
以至于服务器无法处理并崩溃。
the server can't handle them all and crashes.

33
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:54,782
当一家公司发布全新的限量版商品，
The same type of this can accidentally happen when a company releases brand new, limited

34
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:59,582
或者备受追捧的音乐会开始售票，数百万人试图同时登录一个网站时，
edition merchandise, or when highly sought-after concert tickets go on sale and millions of

35
00:01:59,582 --> 00:02:01,515
此类情况可能会发生。
people try to log onto a site at once.

36
00:02:01,715 --> 00:02:06,049
为了发动这次对利比里亚通讯商Lonestar的袭击，凯伊有一个
In order to launch this attack on Lonestar in Liberia, Kaye had an elaborate plan in

37
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:07,382
周密的计划。
mind.

38
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:11,782
具有讽刺意味的是，他发现一个安全摄像头品牌
He had found a brand security cameras, ironically enough, themselves

39
00:02:11,782 --> 00:02:13,582
本身就存在一个可以利用的安全弱点。
had a security weakness that could be exploited.

40
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:19,282
使用一串称为“ Mirai＃14”的代码和命令。基本上是一些黑客手段中的
Using a string of code and commands known as "Mirai #14"， basically some hacking mumbo

41
00:02:19,282 --> 00:02:24,949
巨无霸，凯伊接管了网络摄像头，并于2016年11月3日启动所有摄像头
jumbo, Kaye took control of the web-connected cameras, and on November 3rd, 2016,

42
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,615
同时尝试访问Lonestar的服务器。
sent themall to simultaneously try and access Lonestar's servers.

43
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:32,215
现在，你应该了解下利比里亚当时的互联网
Now, there's something you should know about the internet connection in Liberia at the

44
00:02:32,215 --> 00:02:33,215
连接情况。
time.

45
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:36,849
当时互联网和手机服务提供商的数量非常有限，
There were a very limited number of internet and cell phone service providers back then,

46
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,682
所以该国的大部分流量都是通过Lonestar或Cellcom提供的网络进行的，
so most of the traffic in the country went through either Lonestar or Cellcom networks,

47
00:02:40,682 --> 00:02:45,149
并且大西洋电缆的连接非常有限，这意味着向Lonestar发动的攻击
and alongside having a very limited Atlantic Cable connection, this meant that an attack

48
00:02:45,149 --> 00:02:49,282
可能会使所有通过利比里亚的互联网请求
on Lonestar could mean that all the requests for internet moving through Liberia wouldn't

49
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:50,749
都无法完成。
have any way to be completed.

50
00:02:50,749 --> 00:02:55,315
摄像机一经触发就使Lonestar的网络不堪重负，变得
As soon as the cameras started being used to overwhelm the Lonestar network, it

51
00:02:55,315 --> 00:02:58,882
不稳定，在某些地方甚至直接停止服务。
began to struggle, and in some places even shut down.

52
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:04,082
但是凯伊认为自己没有足够的火力，因此，他还试图利用德国电信（deutsche telekom）
However Kaye didn't think he had enough firepower, so he attempted to also create some

53
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:08,282
在德国国家基站基础设施的另一个安全漏洞，
more DDoS bots by exploiting another security flaw in the national infrastructure

54
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:10,582
制造更多的DDoS进攻节点。
of cell towers in Germany, set up by Deutsche Telekom.

55
00:03:10,582 --> 00:03:15,549
此时，Lonestar邀请了网络安全专家，但是为时已晚。
At this point, Lonestar called in cyber security experts, but it was too late.

56
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:17,982
侵入已经失控了。
The hack had already gotten out of control.

57
00:03:17,982 --> 00:03:22,982
由于利比里亚互联网流量的很大一部分依赖于Lonestar建立的基础设施，
Due to the fact that a large portion of Liberia's internet traffic was dependent on infrastructure

58
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:27,782
在接下来Lonestar受到攻击的两天里，
set up by Lonestar, for the next two days, while Lonestar was under attack, internet

59
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:32,082
全国的互联网用户发现他们无法打电话，
users across the country found that they were unable to make phone calls or even access

60
00:03:32,282 --> 00:03:33,282
甚至无法上网。
the internet.

61
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:38,849
丹尼尔凯伊无意地切断了整个国家的互联网连接。
Without even meaning to, Daniel Kaye had knocked out an entire country's internet

62
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:43,315
这是历史上第一次有人这样做，这完全就是
connection. This was the first time anyone had managed to do this in history, and it

63
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:44,449
意外造成的。
was entirely by accident.

64
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:49,882
2017年2月，经过调查，凯伊因涉嫌实施重大黑客攻击
In February of 2017, following an investigation, Kaye was arrested under suspicion of having

65
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:51,515
而被捕。
committed the major hack.

66
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:55,549
在被捕后，凯伊也被引渡到德国面临指控，
Following his arrest, Kaye was extradited to Germany to face charges there as well,

67
00:03:55,549 --> 00:03:59,949
因为在试图利用德国电信网络资源的过程中，他还成功地
as during his attempt to use resources from the Deutsche Telekom network he had also

68
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:05,182
切断了该公司逾12.4万名客户的互联网连接。
succeeded in knocking out the internet connection of more than 124,000 of their customers.

69
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:08,582
在那里，他也承认了这些指控，尽管这些指控远没有他回到英国后
There too, he pled guilty to the charges, although they were far less severe than the

70
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,782
所面临的严重。
ones he faced when he returned to the UK.

71
00:04:10,982 --> 00:04:14,982
一经德国将凯伊送回英国，根据1990年英国制定的计算机滥用法案，他承认了犯罪行为，
Once Germany sent Kaye back to his homeland, he pled guilty to crimes under the Computer

72
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:20,515
并承认拥有犯罪财产，即他为完成这一切而
Misuse Act of 1990 under UK law, as well as possession of criminal property, namely the

73
00:04:20,515 --> 00:04:23,749
已经收到的10000美元。
10,000 dollars he had received in order to do all of this.

74
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:27,349
在调查过程中，人们发现，在攻击最严重的时候，凯伊在全世界
During the investigation, it was discovered that at the peak of the hack, Kaye had been

75
00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:32,749
控制了100多万台设备，这一切都发生在他一直居住的
in control of over 1 million devices worldwide, all from the comfort of a vacation home in

76
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:34,482
塞浦路斯（Cyprus ）度假别墅里。
Cyprus he had been staying at.

77
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:39,715
凯伊的黑客攻击对Lonestar和整个利比里亚的影响之深远令人难以置信。
The effects of Kaye's hack on Lonestar, and Liberia as a whole, were incredibly far reaching.

78
00:04:39,715 --> 00:04:44,215
他这样做让所有Lonestar的客户，实际上就是整个利比里亚的大多数人，
He had made it so that all of Lonestar's customers, and really most people across Liberia,

79
00:04:44,215 --> 00:04:48,715
完全失去沟通或获取基本服务。
were totally unable to communicate with each other or access basic services.

80
00:04:48,715 --> 00:04:52,349
由于遭到骇客入侵，这些客户中有相当一部分转而投向Lonestar的
As a result of the hack, a substantial number of these customers switched to Lonestar's

81
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:57,215
竞争者，其中就包括Cellcom，最终竟还是达到了目的。
competitors, including Cellcom, who at the end of the day, still got what they wanted.

82
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,715
丹尼尔·凯伊被判入狱32个月，这对于他给利比里亚国家造成的难以置信的破坏
Daniel Kaye was sentenced to serve 32 months in jail, a small price to pay for the incredible

83
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:03,815
来说算是很小的代价。
damage he caused to the nation of Liberia.

84
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:08,549
事实上，凯伊甚至可能从他的被捕中获得了一些好处，因为他的律师曾表示，
In fact, Kaye may have even gained some benefits from his arrest, as his lawyer has stated

85
00:05:08,549 --> 00:05:12,482
自侵入发生以来，几家主要的科技公司已经与凯伊取得了联系，希望招募他来
that since the attack, several major tech companies have reached out to Kaye, wanting

86
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:15,615
使用自己的能力来造福而不是作恶。
to recruit him to use his powers for good instead of evil.

87
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:19,182
那么，如果你的国家的互联网突然中断，你会怎么办？
So what would you do if the internet suddenly went out in your entire country?

88
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:21,115
写在下方评论让我们知道吧。
Let us know down in the comments.

00:05:21,115 --> 00:05:26,115
