1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,419
我们要玩捉迷藏游戏 奖金$5万美元
We are playin' hide and seek for $50, 000.

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:06,256
这里有10个玩家 最后一个被找到的人获得$5万美元现金
There's 10 of them. Last one found gets the $50, 000 in cash.

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:07,924
你们有20分钟的时间藏身
You have 20 minutes to hide.

4
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:08,758
什么？
What?

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,592
19分钟
19 minutes to hide.

6
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:10,844
那只是一秒钟
That would be a second.

7
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,763
谁最后被找到谁就把钱留下 我不在乎是哪位
Whoever's found last gets to keep the money. I don't care who it is.

8
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:14,931
开工
Let's do this.

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,651
我不知道我是想和别人一起还是远离所有人
I don't know if I wanna be with people or away from everyone.

10
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,528
我不知道哪一个更让人费脑筋
I don't know which one's more nerve racking.

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,405
我要便便 我要便便
I gotta poop. I gotta poop.

12
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:31,489
现在不是时候
This is not the time.

13
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:36,077
我今早醒来 带上10个朋友和$5万美元并告诉他们藏起来
So, I woke up this morning, grabbed 10 of my friends and $50, 000 and told 'em to hide.

14
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,412
这就是我一天的内容
That's the extent of my day.

15
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,747
我想知道钱德勒藏在哪里？
I wonder where Chandler's hiding?

16
00:00:38,747 --> 00:00:39,831
好了 我要去拉屎了
All right, I'm gonna go poop real quick.

17
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,959
我去 这不能锁？ 开玩笑的吧？
Dude, this doesn't lock? Are you kidding me?

18
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,880
这座建筑有数百个房间 成千上万的藏身之处
This building has hundreds of rooms and thousands of hiding spots,

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,840
所以 我不可能一个人找到他们
so, there's no way I can find them on my own.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,633
所以我会和克里斯一起寻找
So, me and Chris are gonna be working together.

21
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,552
我们得制定个策略 克里斯
We need to devise a strategy, Chris.

22
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,346
你应该用你的眼睛 我用我的眼睛
You should use your eyes and I use my eyes.

23
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,931
听起来像是个可靠的计划
That sounds like a solid plan.

24
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,807
出发
Let's do it.

25
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,976
我想知道谁的藏身之处最蠢
I wonder who has the dumbest hiding spot.

26
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,811
我躲在剧院里
I'm hiding in a theater.

27
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,938
就像又回到高中一样
It's like high school all over again.

28
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,565
嘘 没人会知道
Shhh no one will know.

29
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,817
我和杰克（Jake）现在正躲在T台上
Me and Jake are currently hiding in the catwalk.

30
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,319
我们同时出现
We both showed up at the same time.

31
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,779
我们就藏在这里 一起
We're just gonna be here, together.

32
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,406
这有一个宝箱 我可以藏在这里
So, there's this treasure chest. I can hide in this.

33
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,241
我要蹲下来在这里呆一会儿了
I'm gonna hunker down and stay in here for a while.

34
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,159
再见各位
Bye guys.

35
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,207
我们把梯子弄走了 所以没法知道我们在哪儿
We got rid of the ladder so there's no way to tell where we are.

36
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,959
我们在这上面 我们做到了 希望能赢
We are up here. We did it. Hopefully win it.

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,838
朋友们 你们要么拿着$5万美元走人 要么什么都拿不到
Guys, you can walk away with $50, 000 or nothing.

38
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,715
还有一分钟
There are one minutes left.

39
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,344
记住 钱德勒 在我们开始挑战之前你不能出去
Remember, Chandler you can't get out until we start the challenge.

40
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,178
嘻哈
Dab.

41
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,138
只剩一分钟了 祝我好运吧
One minute left guys, wish me luck.

42
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,058
我是这里的学生 所以我知道所有的藏身地
I'm a student here so I know all of the hiding spots.

43
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,476
那个位置很好
The good ones, that is.

44
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,894
30秒
30 seconds.

45
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,145
30秒 我和本找了一个地方
30 seconds. Me and Ben found a spot.

46
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,814
如果他们让我们离开 我们就分道扬镳
If they tell us to move, we're gonna go our separate ways,

47
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,982
但在那之前 这里是个好地方
but until then, right here, this is a good spot.

48
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:48,817
你觉得这个地怎么样？
What do you think about this spot?

49
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,651
这是个好地方
It's a good spot.

50
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,485
很好吗？
Pretty good?

51
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,072
时间到 准备好了吗 我们来了
Times up. Ready or not here we come.

52
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:59,077
我认为一个好的策略是沿着所有的走廊走 然后我们进入所有的房间
I think a good strategy would be to just walk down all the hallways and then afterwards we go in all the rooms.

53
00:01:59,077 --> 00:01:59,911
可以
Okay.

54
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,788
哦 那是个很好的藏身之处
Oh, that would be a great hiding spot.

55
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,289
嘿 德雷克 有人在这里
Hey, Drake, someone's in here.

56
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,124
什么？
What?

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,835
逮到了
Got him.

58
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,795
有10人 我们还没找到人
There's 10 people. We haven't found anyone yet.

59
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,425
好吧 这是地下室
All right, this is the basement.

60
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,470
我们先从这个房间开始 然后在所有的房间里慢慢来找
We're gonna start with this room and we're gonna work our way around all the rooms.

61
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,514
不管谁在这个房间 你都完了
Whoever's in this room, you're done.

62
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:22,016
我想后面那个角落里有人
I think there's someone in that corner back there.

63
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,602
啊 没人
Awwwww, man.

64
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,438
老弟 看看这个地方
Dude, look at this place.

65
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,525
不会吧
No freakin' way.

66
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,193
我们发现钱德勒
We found Chandler.

67
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,528

68
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,613
好了 来吧钱德勒 你得进监狱
All right, c'mon Chandler, you have to go to jail.

69
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,823
我是第一个？
Am I the first one?

70
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,325
是的 你是第一个 第一被逮出局的
Yes, you are the first you really are the first one out You're the first one out.

00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,162
你是第一个被发现的 你今晚要待在监狱里了
You were the first one found, you must now spend the night in jail.

72
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,873
我很高兴地告诉大家钱德勒被找到了
I am happy to report that Chandler has been found.

73
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,748
还有九个
Nine to go.

74
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,293
你躲在显眼的地方 却不管用
You hide in plain sight and it doesn't work.

75
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,044
一个倒下 还有九个
One down, nine more to go.

76
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,421
我们来了
We're comin' for you.

77
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,633
这栋楼里有个电影院 而我们才到了二楼
This building has a movie theater in it, and we're only on the second floor.

78
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,303
这里有很多地方可以躲
There's so many places to hide in here.

79
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,097
我向你保证有人藏在其中一个位置上
I guarantee you there's someone hiding in one of these seats.

80
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,473
我找到了一个梯子
I found a ladder.

81
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,267
这座大楼很大
This building is huge.

82

还以为这里肯定有人
Thought for sure someone would be up here.

83
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,979
说实话 我们还在这里真是个奇迹
Honestly, it's a miracle we're still here.

84
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,731
他们要把我们俩都干掉
They were about to take both of us out.

85
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,274
朋友们 我们现在在三楼
Oh, we're on the third floor guys.

86
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,483
不知怎么的 我们上了楼
Somehow we went up a floor.

87
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:13,651

有办法进去吗？
Is there a way to get in it?

96
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:38,676
他们真的碰到了我藏身的箱子 却说没有办法进入
They literally hit the box I'm in and said there's no way to get in.

97
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:39,677
我们从未检查过这个舞厅
We never checked this ballroom.

98
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,096
哇 这个舞厅里可以玩很多球
Wow, you could have a lot of balls in this ballroom.

99
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,598

Eh, eh, eh

100
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,266

只是我赢了$5万美元 原谅我
It's just me winning $50, 000, I'm sorry.

你怎么知道这地的？
How did you know about this?

103
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:52,982
怎么回事？老弟
What in the world dude?

104
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,817
我以为肯定有人藏在这里
Thought for sure someone would be hiding here.

105
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,361
哇 这是什么？
Whoa, what is this?

00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:57,237
你要我去看看
You want me to check it out

107
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,655
天呐 我们发现了一个秘密的通道
Dude, we just found a secret crevice.

108
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,530
老天
Dude.

来吧 我们去监狱吧 泰
C'mon, let's go to jail Ty.

111
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:08,790
给力 老兄
Dude, yes.

112
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,291
又一名选手倒下了
Another contestant has fallen.

113
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,334
只剩下八个了
Only eight remain.

114
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,544
钱德勒 我们给你带了个朋友
All right, Chandler, we brought you a friend.

115
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,546
好的 泰 请进
All right Ty enter.

116
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,381
监狱坏了
Jail broke.

117
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,132
我真是在瞎胡说
I was talkin' mad junk, too.

118
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,384
我还以为你找到了一个好地儿
I thought you found a good spot.

119
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,678
我也这么想的 老弟
I thought I had it too, man. Man.

120
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,887
好了 我们回来了
All right we're back.

121
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,264
这东西大约400磅

我有三个 要一个吗？
I got three of 'em, want one?

123
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,810
好了
There go.

124
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:33,898
我们假设要么是泰勒（Tyler） 要么是杰克 要么是加勒特（Garrett）一直在给我们打电话
Our hypothesis is either Tyler, Jake or Garrett is constantly calling us.

125
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,192
他们可能在定位我们的位置
They're probably tryin' to find our location.

126
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,903
看到有人跑过 飞快的那种
Saw someone run across, like run run.

127
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,323
我们走吧
Let's go.

128
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,663
哦 他跑这了
Oh, there he is.

129
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,580
他去哪里？
Where's he goin?

130
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,792
可能要走楼梯
Probably gonna take the stairs.

131
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,751
他去哪儿了？
Where did he go?

132
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,420
只要电梯门一关上
As soon as this elevator door closes.

133
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,088
我们会追上你的 通话完毕
We're comin' after you, over and out.

134
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,131
让我们这样做
Let's do this.

135
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,716
只有$5万美元
It's only 50 grand.

136
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,302
我又不是要付账单什么的
It's not like I got bills to pay or anything.

137
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,763
我要去盘问钱德勒一些线索
I'm gonna go probe Chandler for some info.

138
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,432
钱德勒 能给我点情报吗？
Hey, Chandler, can you give me some intel?

139
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,391
给我一小勺情报
Give me a little scoop.

140
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,225
你要找谁？
Who you lookin' for?

141
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,436
不是一大勺 一小勺
Not like a giant scoop, a small scoop.

142
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:12,979
尖锥形的小勺子
One that sinks in the cone.

143
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,938
是向上还是向下
Is it up or down.

144
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:14,772
我们在几楼？
What floor are we on?

145
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,024
二楼
Two.

146
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,861
罗杰 我拿到了内幕消息
Roger, I got the inside scoop.

147
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,695
我能得到什么？
What do I get?

148
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:21,654
我会考虑的
I'll think about it.

149
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,616
克里斯 克里斯 克里斯
Chris, Chris, Chris,

150
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,076
可能已经在行动了
might already be on the move.

151
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,746
我要饿死了
I'm gonna starve.

152
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,374
我们要找个新地方
We are gonna find a new spot.

153
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,418
是不是有人 碰巧 藏在你桌子底下？
Is someone, by any chance, hiding under your desk?

154
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,461
需要检查一下
Have to check.

155
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,506
好吧 你明白了
Okay, you're clear.

156
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,841
克里斯 我想我在这发现了什么
Chris, I think I found somethin' over here.

157
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,677
等等 只是我自己一个巨大的版本
Wait, it's just a giant version of myself.

158
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,928
这东西挺酷的
This things kinda cool.

159
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:49,057
这让我想起了我们和尤图兹（You Tooz）合作出售的的新产品
It reminds me of the new figures we're selling in partnership with You Tooz.

160
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:53,603
我时间有点紧 因为我在找人 所以我会让未来的我介绍尤图兹
I'm a little pressed for time'cause I'm finding people, so, I'm gonna let future me tell you about You Tooz.

161
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,687
在我们继续之前
Before we go any further,

162
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,898
我要告诉你们我们新的收藏玩具
I need to tell you about our new collectable toys.

163
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,318
你看 我们下个月要花几百万美元 我也想养活钱德勒
You see, we're spending millions of dollars next month and I wanna feed Chandler.

164
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,152
我饿了
I'm hungry.

165
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,489
这些是我们尤图兹的巨型版本 我们要做的是限量版
These are giant versions of our You Tooz which we're gonna doa limited edition run.

166
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,617
这里有一个有趣的事实 如果你买了克里斯的玩具 克里斯会得到钱
And, here's a fun fact, if you buy a Chris toy, Chris gets money,

167
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,952
如果你买了钱德勒的玩具 钱德勒就能得到钱
and if you buy a Chandler toy, Chandler gets money.

168
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,581
还有 买我的玩具 我可能还会把钱给克里斯或钱德勒
And also, buy my toy and I'll probably give the money to Chris or Chandler still.

169
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,917
这些都是按照我们想要的方式设计和建模的
These were designed and modeled exactly how we wanted.

170
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,003
我是说 钱德勒穿着和玩具同样的衣服 我们都没告诉他这么做
I mean, Chandler's literally wearing the same thing and we didn't even tell him to.

171
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,296
钱德勒 多少钱？
Now, Chandler, how much are they?

172
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,422
29 99美元
$29. 99.

173
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,256
什么是免费的？
And what's free?

174
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,051
你会买吗？ 买
And, are you gonna buy, yes.

175
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,805
另外 随机三个买了我们的尤图兹的人会得到一张金奖券
Also, three random people that buy one of our You Tooz will get a golden ticket.

176
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,642
如果你得到这张巨大的金奖券 我们会把它送到你家里
If you get this giant golden ticket, we will deliver this to your house

177
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,977
我们可能会让你拍个视频 我不确定
and also, we might let you be in a video, I dunno.

178
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,687

181
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,900
去买吧 结尾我会提醒你的
Go buy and I'll remind you at the end.

182
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,984
我们回去继续捉迷藏
Let's go back to hiding.

183
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,694
克里斯 这是个大房间
Chris, this is a big room.

184
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,154
这里一定有人
Someone's gotta be in here.

185
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,823
不在那里 不在那里
Not there. Not there.

186
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,950
检查 没有
Check, no.

187
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,451
上面没人
No one's up there.

188
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,787
我们在这里检查一下
Let's check up here.

189
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,540
你觉得我们在这里能做什么？
What do you think we can do in here?

190
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,791
我要到后面去
I'm gonna get behind here.

191
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,835
我们刚刚发现了一个全新的领域
We just discovered a brand new area.

192
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,461
我都不知道就是这里
I didn't even know this was here.

193
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,214
这些是运动传感器浴室
These are motion sensor bathrooms.

194
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,467
当我们经过走廊的时候 这个运动传感器已经被触发了
This motion sensor was already triggered when we came down the hallway.

195
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,678
我能听到吉米的声音 他来了
I can currently hear Jimmy, he's coming.

196
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,097
我们在冰箱里
We're in the fridge.

197
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,602
我发现你了
I found you.

198
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,980
噢 是的 是的
Oh yeah, yes.

199
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,567
好的 来吧
All right, here you go.

200
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,568
感觉怎么样 伙计们？
How's it feel, guys?

201
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,861
老实说 感觉很棒
It feels great, honestly.

202
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,531
哦 是的 老兄
Oh, yeah, dude.

203
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,365
哦 我听到了
Oh, I heard that.

204
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,324
来自通风口
Came from the air vent.

205
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,451
-你再做一次 -不
-You do that again, -No.

206
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,703
我们怎么还没找到维京人？
How've we not found Viking yet?

207
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,496
我知道 他很大块头
I know. He's huge.

208
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,623
但是 公平地说 我们还没去过每个房间呢
But, to be fair, we haven't even gone in every room yet.

209
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:41,043
因为我们真的需要找人 所以我要打作弊牌
Because we really need to find people, I'm gonna have to play a cheat card.

210
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:45,798
在接下来的10分钟内 你们都必须移动到一个不同的楼层
You all have to move to a different floor than you currently are on within the next 10 minutes.

211
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,800
我们要去搜查 我甚至会给你一个提示
We are gonna be scouring. I'll even give you a hint.

212
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,719
我们现在在二楼 好运
We're currently on the second floor. Good luck.

213
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,097
这与其说是一个暗示 不如说是一个确切的地点
That was less of a hint and more of an exact location.

214
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:53,890
但是 我喜欢你的风格
But, I like your style.

215
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,766
好的 我在去的路上
All right, so I'm on the way.

216
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,685
拿着我找到的尤图兹
Got my You Tooz I found.

217
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,479
我得换层楼了
I gotta get to a different floor.

218
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,398
吉米刚用无线电通知我们 说我们得换一层楼
Jimmy just radioed us and told us that we have to go to a different floor.

219
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,317
如果我们发现电梯里有人呢？
What if we found someone in the elevator?

220
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,568
那会很搞笑的
That would be hilarious.

221
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,861
花了一段时间（电梯）才到
It took awhile to get up here.

222
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,321
地下室的时候也是
It was at the basement, too.

223
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,157
电梯没开 有人在里面
It's not opening. Somebody's in there.

224
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,241
快 快 快 快 快
Go, go, go, go, go.

225
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,743
走 跟着他
Go, follow him.

226
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,581
这有一瓶水 有人渴了
There's a bottle of water. Somebody got thirsty.

227
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,584
我要准备好冲刺了
I gotta be ready to sprint.

228
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,505
错的
wrong way.

229
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,721
哦
Oh

230
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:36,224
该死 老铁 我听见有人在电梯里咳嗽
Darn it. Dude, I heard someone coughing in the elevator.

231
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,600
它停在这一层
It stopped on this floor.

232
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,315
逮到你了
Gotcha.

233
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,983
天啊 你怎么看到我的？
oh man, how did you see me?

234
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,485
加勒特被找到了
Garrett has been found.

235
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,445
重复一遍 加勒特被找到了
I repeat, Garrett has been found.

236
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,363
欢迎来到监狱
Welcome to prison.

237
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,447
所以 我们必须考虑一下
So, we have to think about it.

238
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:55,076
马库斯（Marcus）小个子 他能适应较小的空间
Marcus is smaller. He can fit in smaller spaces.

239
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,494
啊 啊 啊
Unh, huh, hul.

240
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,703
老兄 我要办它
Dude, I'm callin' it.

241
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:00,831
等等 等等
Hold up, hold up.

242
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,292
不会吧
No freakin' way.

243
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:04,835
有人在这里过
Someone was in here.

244
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,339
-不可思议 我打赌当我们检查时有人就在这里 -卧槽
-No freakin' way I bet you they were in here when we checked -No.

245
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,841
吉米和克里斯就在我旁边
Jimmy and Chris are right beside me.

246
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,135
我们早些搬的时候很重
When we went to move that earlier it was heavy.

247
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,929
现在移动它就像一根羽毛
Moving it just then was like a feather.

248
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,264
先前有人在里面
There was someone in there earlier.

249
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,181
我们快没时间了
We're runnin' outta time.

250
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,266
我们得做点什么
We need to do somethin'.

251
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:21,185
你觉得我们能不能再搞一次hut hut hike 420？（FNL赛场信号）
Do you think we can pull another double whammy, hut, hut hike 420?

252
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,939
注意 我们肯定快没时间了 你们还剩下很多人
Attention, we are definitely running out of time and there's still a lot of you left,

253
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,860
所以 我需要你们去一个你们现在不在的楼层
so, I'm gonna need you guys to go to a floor that you are not currently on.

254
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,779
你们有10分钟 好运
You have 10 minutes. Good luck.

255
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,155
他们可能都在行动
They're probably all on the move.

256
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,782
来吧
Let's do it.

257
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:35,616
嘿
Hey.

258
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,079
那就是我藏的地方
That's where I was hiding.

259
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,330
你知道他们会在楼梯上等着
You know they're gonna wait in the stairs.

260
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,623
我也是临场发挥 老兄
I'm wingin' it dude.

261
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,834
到这个点了 我真的只是想要运气
I'm literally just tryin' to be lucky at this point.

262
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:45,668
我也是
Me too.

263
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:52,258
我现在的藏身点可能是整个地方最亮的
My current hiding spot might be the brightest spot in this whole place.

264
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,260
我不知道该去哪里
I had no idea where to go.

265
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,763
电梯灯亮着
That light was on.

266
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,644
现在 我们在玩等待游戏
Now, we play the waiting game.

267
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:08,065
电梯移动了 有人叫了电梯
We're moving. Someone called the elevator.

268
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,823
你为什么要进电梯？
Why did you go in the elevator?

269
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,242
我们逮住你了 为什么要选电梯？
We got you why did you go in elevator?

270
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,202
不 不
Noooooo, no.

271
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:22,038
一箭俩沙雕
Two at a time.

272
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,789
噢 我的天啊
Oh my gosh.

273
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,501
来了个特别的 买一送一
They were havin' special, we got two for one.

274
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,631
目前有六人在监狱 也就是说你们只剩下四个人了
There are currently six people in jail, which means there's only four of you left.

275
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,134
你们中只有一个人能拿到$5万美元
Only one of you are gonna walk away with $50, 000,

276
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,594
所以希望你们能藏好
so I hope you guys hide well.

277
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,641
找到这个尤图兹 你被奖励了两千美元 又一次？
By finding this You Tooz, you're now awarded two grand, again?

278
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,019
四千美元 全因为这些尤图兹
Four grand all for these You Tooz.

279
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,395
哦 吉米 我放弃了
Oh, Jimmy, I give up.

280
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:50,566
赛姬 快五万四千了我要躲在椅子里
Psyche, it's about to be 54 grand and I'm about to hide in these chairs.

281
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,068
你觉得他会来这里找我吗？
Think he's gonna look for me down here?

282
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,611
这很冒险
This is pretty risky.

283
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,862
以后再见
See ya later.

284
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,577
我们进退两难
We have a dilemma.

285
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:05,748
我们还剩下一个小时 还有四个人
We have one hour left with this giant building and there's four people that remain.

286
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:07,208
我想我们需要制定一个计划
I think we need to devise a plan.

287
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,126
要是我们叫他们都到同一层楼里去呢
What if we told 'em all to go to a single floor.

288
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:12,046
剩下的四个人 我们还有一个小时的时间
To the four of you that remain, we have about an hour left.

289
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,464
我们得加点料
We need to spice some things up.

290
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,342
所以 我们要把范围限制在两层
So, we're gonna limit the range to two floors.

291
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:20,304
你有10分钟的时间去二楼和三楼 你需要躲在那两层楼里
You have 10 minutes to get to floor two and three and you need to hide on those two floors.

292
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,973
他们只是叫我换楼层
They just told me to move floors.

293
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,350
所以我们现在在二楼
So, we are on the second floor right now.
