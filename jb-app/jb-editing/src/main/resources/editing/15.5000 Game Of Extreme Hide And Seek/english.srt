1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,470
- We are playin' hide
and seek for $50,000.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:06,280
There's 10 of them. Last one
found gets the $50,000 in cash.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,940
You have 20 minutes to hide.

4
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:08,773
- What?

5
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:09,606
- 19 minutes to hide.

6
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:10,880
- That would be a second.

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,820
Whoever's found last
gets to keep the money.

8
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I don't care who it is.

9
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,123
- Let's do this.

10
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:18,123
(suspenseful music)

11
00:00:23,916 --> 00:00:25,580
- I don't know if I wanna be with people

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,670
or away from everyone.

13
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,541
I don't know which one's
more nerve racking.

14
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,420
I gotta poop. I gotta poop.

15
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,540
This is not the time.

16
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,870
- So, I woke up this morning,

17
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:36,100
grabbed 10 of my friends and
$50,000 and told 'em to hide.

18
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,430
That's the extent of my day.

19
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,772
I wonder where Chandler's hiding?

20
00:00:38,772 --> 00:00:39,880
- All right, I'm gonna go poop real quick.

21
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,000
Dude, this doesn't lock?
Are you kidding me?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,290
This building has hundreds of rooms

23
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,920
and thousands of hiding spots,

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,860
so, there's no way I
can find them on my own.

25
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,680
So, me and Chris are
gonna be working together.

26
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,600
We need to devise a strategy, Chris.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,400
You should use your
eyes and I use my eyes.

28
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,950
- That sounds like a solid plan.

29
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,860
- Let's do it.

30
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,000
I wonder who has the dumbest hiding spot.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
I'm hiding in a theater.

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,970
It's like high school all over again.

33
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,590
- Shhh no one will know.

34
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,830
- Me and Jake are currently
hiding in the catwalk.

35
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,370
- We both showed up at the same time.

36
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,800
We're just gonna be here, together.

37
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,420
- So, there's this treasure
chest. I can hide in this.

38
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm gonna hunker down and
stay in here for awhile.

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,193
Bye guys.

40
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,210
- We got rid of the ladder
so there's no way to tell

41
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,220
where we are.

42
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,980
- We are up here. We did
it. Hopefully win it.

43
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,880
- Guys, you can walk away
with $50,000 or nothing.

44
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,740
- There are one minutes left.

45
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,360
Remember, Chandler you can't get out

46
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,370
until we start the challenge.

47
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,203
Dab.

48
00:01:35,203 --> 00:01:37,183
- One minute left guys, wish me luck.

49
00:01:37,183 --> 00:01:40,070
- I'm a student here so I
know all of the hiding spots.

50
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,490
The good ones, that is.

51
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,910
- 30 seconds.

52
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,180
- 30 seconds. Me and Ben found a spot.

53
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,013
If they tell us to move,

54
00:01:45,013 --> 00:01:45,846
we're gonna go our separate ways,

55
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:48,000
but until then, right
here, this is a good spot.

56
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,848
- What do you think about this spot?

57
00:01:48,848 --> 00:01:49,681
- It's a good spot.

58
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:50,529
- Pretty good?

59
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:51,362
(loud horn blows)

60
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:54,090
- Times up. Ready or not here we come.

61
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,490
I think a good strategy
would be to just walk down

62
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,099
all the hallways and then
afterwards we go in all the rooms.

63
00:01:59,099 --> 00:01:59,932
- Okay.

64
00:01:59,932 --> 00:02:01,840
Oh, that would be a great hiding spot.

65
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,309
- Hey, Drake, someone's in here.

66
00:02:03,309 --> 00:02:04,142
- What?

67
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,873
Got him.

68
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:08,809
- There's 10 people. We
haven't found anyone yet.

69
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:12,483
(suspenseful music)

70
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:14,440
All right, this is the basement.

71
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,490
We're gonna start with this room

72
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,500
and we're gonna work our
way around all the rooms.

73
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,560
Whoever's in this room, you're done.

74
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,060
I think there's someone
in that corner back there.

75
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:24,633
Awwwww, man.

76
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,460
- Dude, look at this place.

77
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,565
No freakin' way.

78
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:32,213
We found Chandler.

79
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:33,560
Nooooooooo.

80
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,650
- All right, c'mon Chandler,
you have to go to jail.

81
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,840
- Am I the first one?

82
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,790
Yes, you are the first
- you really are

83
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,350
the first one out
- You're the first one out.

84
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,460
You were the first one found,

85
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,200
you must now spend the night in jail.

86
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,920
I am happy to report that
Chandler has been found.

87
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,770
Nine to go.

88
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,340
- You hide in plain sight
and it doesn't work.

89
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,070
- One down, nine more to go.

90
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,463
We're comin' for you.

91
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,350
This building has a movie theater in it,

92
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,660
and we're only on the second floor.

93
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,340
- There's so many places to hide in here.

94
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,050
- I guarantee you there's someone hiding

95
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,130
in one of these seats.

96
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,500
- I found a ladder.

97
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,280
- This building is huge.

98
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,900
Thought for sure someone would be up here.

99
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,000
- Honestly, it's a
miracle we're still here.

100
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
- They were about to take both of us out.

101
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,290
- Oh, we're on the third floor guys.

102
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,530
Somehow we went up a floor.

103
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:13,671
Abracadabra, nope.

104
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,957
- [Jimmy Johns Employee] Thank
you for calling Jimmy Johns.

105
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:16,945
- Can I make an order for delivery?

106
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:18,490
Yes, I'm starving.

107
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,910
(doorbell rings)

108
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,660
- Thank you so much, thank
you, this is amazing.

109
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,273
Let's go.
(door slams)

110
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,630
- Jimmy and Chris are right beside me.

111
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,189
- Take this off.

112
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,343
Is there a way to get in it?

113
00:03:33,343 --> 00:03:36,390
- They literally hit the box I'm in

114
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,883
and said there's no way to get in.

115
00:03:37,883 --> 00:03:38,716
(screams)

116
00:03:38,716 --> 00:03:39,730
- We never checked this ballroom.

117
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,111
- Wow, you could have a lot
of balls in this ballroom.

118
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:43,610
- Eh, eh, eh

119
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,315
- Wait a second, I hear something.

120
00:03:45,315 --> 00:03:48,273
It's just me winning $50,000, I'm sorry.

121
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,587
- How did you know about this?

122
00:03:51,587 --> 00:03:53,000
- What in the world dude?

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,870
- Thought for sure someone
would be hiding here.

124
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,375
Whoa, what is this?

125
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,285
- You want me to check it out

126
00:03:57,285 --> 00:03:58,700
- Dude, we just found a secret crevice.

127
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,553
- Dude.

128
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,756
- Ty, nooooooo.

129
00:04:04,756 --> 00:04:06,210
(screams)

130
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,003
- C'mon, let's go to jail Ty.

131
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:08,836
- Dude, yes.

132
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:10,340
- Another contestant has fallen.

133
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,370
Only eight remain.

134
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,560
All right, Chandler, we
brought you a friend.

135
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,600
All right Ty enter.

136
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,433
Jail broke.

137
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,147
- I was talkin' mad junk, too.

138
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:19,420
- I thought you found a good spot.

139
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,709
- I thought I had it too, man.
- Man.

140
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:22,910
- All right we're back.

141
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,310
This things like 400 pounds.

142
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,007
I got three of 'em, want one?

143
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:28,856
There go.

144
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:29,689
(phone rings)

145
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:32,580
- Our hypothesis is either
Tyler, Jake or Garrett

146
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:33,940
is constantly calling us.

147
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,240
- They're probably tryin'
to find our location.

148
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,950
- Saw someone run across, like run run.

149
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,453
- Saw someone run across, like run run.

150
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:42,370
- Let's go.

151
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:48,710
- Oh, there he is.

152
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,610
- Where's he goin?

153
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,822
- Probably gonna take the stairs.

154
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:53,770
Where did he go?

155
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:55,460
As soon as this elevator door closes.

156
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,120
We're comin' after you, over and out.

157
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,170
Let's do this.

158
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,760
- It's only 50 grand.

159
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,327
It's not like I got
bills to pay or anything.

160
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,810
- I'm gonna go probe
Chandler for some info.

161
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,480
Hey, Chandler, can you give me some intel?

162
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,440
Give me a little scoop.

163
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
- Who you lookin' for?

164
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:11,480
- Not like a giant scoop, a small scoop.

165
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,000
One that sinks in the cone.

166
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,982
Is it up or down.

167
00:05:13,982 --> 00:05:14,815
- What floor are we on?

168
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,042
- Two.

169
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,840
(laughs)

170
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,890
Roger, I got the inside scoop.

171
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,723
- What do I get?

172
00:05:20,723 --> 00:05:21,700
- I'll think about it.

173
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:23,888
(laughs)

174
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:25,640
Chris, Chris, Chris,

175
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,090
might already be on the move.

176
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,780
- I'm gonna starve.

177
00:05:31,928 --> 00:05:33,410
We are gonna find a new spot.

178
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,443
- Is someone, by any chance,
hiding under your desk?

179
00:05:35,443 --> 00:05:36,493
Have to check.

180
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,530
Okay, you're clear.

181
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,860
Chris, I think I found
somethin' over here.

182
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,710
Wait, it's just a giant version of myself.

183
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,970
This things kinda cool.

184
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,990
It reminds me of the new
figures we're selling

185
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,087
in partnership with You Tooz.

186
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,100
I'm a little pressed for time
'cause I'm finding people

187
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,630
so, I'm gonna let future
me tell you about You Tooz.

188
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,730
Before we go any further,

189
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,930
I need to tell you about
our new collectable toys.

190
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,030
You see, we're spending
millions of dollars next month

191
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,360
and I wanna feed Chandler.

192
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,193
- I'm hungry.

193
00:06:01,193 --> 00:06:02,670
- These are giant versions of our You Tooz

194
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,530
which we're gonna do
a limited edition run.

195
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,570
And, here's a fun fact,

196
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,670
if you buy a Chris toy, Chris gets money,

197
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,000
and if you buy a Chandler
toy, Chandler gets money.

198
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,290
And also, buy my toy and
I'll probably give the money

199
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,630
to Chris or Chandler still.

200
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,950
These were designed and
modeled exactly how we wanted.

201
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,020
I mean, Chandler's literally
wearing the same thing

202
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,023
and we didn't even tell him to.

203
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,347
Now, Chandler, how much are they?

204
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:21,450
- $29.99.

205
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,283
- And what's free?

206
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:23,860
- The shipping to anywhere in the world.

207
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,080
- And, are you gonna buy, yes.

208
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,610
Also, three random people
that buy one of our You Tooz

209
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,820
will get a golden ticket.

210
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,650
If you get this giant golden ticket,

211
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,410
we will deliver this to your house

212
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:35,004
and also, we might let you
be in a video, I dunno.

213
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,730
Limited edition, they're out now.

214
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,030
Go buy. Buy, buy, buy.

215
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,460
You could be in a video, who knows?

216
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,930
Go buy and I'll remind you at the end.

217
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,010
Let's go back to hiding.

218
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,720
Chris, this is a big room.

219
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,190
Someone's gotta be in here.

220
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,860
Not there. Not there.

221
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,000
Check, no.

222
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,470
No one's up there.

223
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,832
Let's check up here.

224
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:55,557
- What do you think we can do in here?

225
00:06:55,557 --> 00:06:56,830
I'm gonna get behind here.

226
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,860
- We just discovered a brand new area.

227
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,483
I didn't even know this was here.

228
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,230
These are motion sensor bathrooms.

229
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,950
This motion sensor was already triggered

230
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,943
when we came down the hallway.

231
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:08,705
- I can currently hear Jimmy, he's coming.

232
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:10,040
This is it.

233
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,140
- We're in the fridge.

234
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:16,638
- I found you.

235
00:07:17,929 --> 00:07:19,017
Oh yeah, yes.

236
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,636
(screams)

237
00:07:20,636 --> 00:07:22,620
- All right, here you go.

238
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,590
How's it feel, guys?

239
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,880
- It feels great, honestly.

240
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,603
(laughs)

241
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,570
- Oh, yeah, dude.

242
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,403
- Oh, I heard that.

243
00:07:29,403 --> 00:07:30,357
- Came from the air vent.

244
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:31,488
- You do that again,
- No.

245
00:07:31,488 --> 00:07:32,321
- you're kicked out.

246
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,740
- How've we not found Viking yet?

247
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,520
- I know.
- He's huge.

248
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,650
- But, to be fair, we haven't
even gone in every room yet.

249
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,500
Because we really need to find people,

250
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,090
I'm gonna have to play a cheat card.

251
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,070
You all have to move to a different floor

252
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,840
than you currently are on
within the next 10 minutes.

253
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,850
We are gonna be scouring.
I'll even give you a hint.

254
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,770
We're currently on the
second floor. Good luck.

255
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,110
- That was less of a hint and
more of an exact location.

256
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,943
But, I like your style.

257
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,810
- All right, so I'm on the way.

258
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,710
Got my You Tooz I found.

259
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,530
I gotta get to a different floor.

260
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,603
Jimmy just radioed us and told us

261
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:02,440
that we have to go to a different floor.

262
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,351
- What if we found
someone in the elevator?

263
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,620
- That would be hilarious.

264
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
It took awhile to get up here.

265
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,363
It was at the basement, too.

266
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:11,182
It's not opening. Somebody's in there.

267
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:12,267
Go, go, go, go, go.

268
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,776
Go, follow him.

269
00:08:13,776 --> 00:08:16,130
(grunt)

270
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,630
- There's a bottle of
water. Somebody got thirsty.

271
00:08:19,972 --> 00:08:21,606
- I gotta be ready to sprint.

272
00:08:21,606 --> 00:08:24,699
(suspenseful music)

273
00:08:24,699 --> 00:08:25,532
wrong way.

274
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,750
Oh (laughs)

275
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,250
- Darn it. Dude, I heard someone
coughing in the elevator.

276
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,630
- It stopped on this floor.

277
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:40,630
(suspenseful music)

278
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,360
- Gotcha.

279
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,020
(laughs) oh man, how did you see me?

280
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,510
- Garrett has been found.

281
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,460
I repeat, Garrett has been found.

282
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,380
Welcome to prison.

283
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,470
- So, we have to think about it.

284
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,090
Marcus is smaller. He can
fit in smaller spaces.

285
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,520
- Unh, huh, hul.

286
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,743
Dude, I'm callin' it.

287
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,850
- Hold up, hold up.

288
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:03,329
No freakin' way.

289
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,861
- Someone was in here.

290
00:09:04,861 --> 00:09:06,520
- No freakin' way
- I bet you they were in here

291
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,370
when we checked
- No.

292
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,890
- Jimmy and Chris are right beside me.

293
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,160
- When we went to move
that earlier it was heavy.

294
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,980
Moving it just then was like a feather.

295
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,300
There was someone in there earlier.

296
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,230
We're runnin' outta time.

297
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,310
We need to do somethin'.

298
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,890
Do you think we can pull
another double whammy,

299
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,220
hut, hut hike 420?

300
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,560
Attention, we are definitely
running out of time

301
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,990
and there's still a lot of you left,

302
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,410
so, I'm gonna need you
guys to go to a floor

303
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:29,900
that you are not currently on.

304
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,800
You have 10 minutes. Good luck.

305
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,170
They're probably all on the move.

306
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,812
Let's do it.

307
00:09:34,812 --> 00:09:35,645
- Hey.

308
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,104
- That's where I was hiding.

309
00:09:40,104 --> 00:09:41,350
You know they're gonna wait in the stairs.

310
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm wingin' it dude.

311
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,870
I'm literally just tryin'
to be lucky at this point.

312
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,703
- Me too.

313
00:09:45,703 --> 00:09:49,690
- My current hiding spot
might be the brightest spot

314
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,213
in this whole place.

315
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:54,283
I had no idea where to go.

316
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:56,611
(beep)

317
00:09:56,611 --> 00:09:57,783
- That light was on.

318
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,660
Now, we play the waiting game.

319
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,233
(beep)

320
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,079
- We're moving. Someone
called the elevator.

321
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,038
We're goin' to the basement.

322
00:10:11,038 --> 00:10:13,205
(screams)

323
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,852
- Why did you go in the elevator?

324
00:10:15,852 --> 00:10:18,250
- We got you
- why did you go in elevator?

325
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,248
- Noooooo, no.

326
00:10:20,248 --> 00:10:22,078
Two at a time.

327
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:23,830
Oh my gosh.

328
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,530
- They were havin' special,
we got two for one.

329
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,810
- There are currently six people in jail,

330
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,650
which means there's only four of you left.

331
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:35,180
Only one of you are gonna
walk away with $50,000,

332
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,630
so I hope you guys hide well.

333
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,700
- By finding this You Tooz,

334
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,235
you're now awarded two grand, again?

335
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:45,047
Four grand all for these You Tooz.

336
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:46,432
Oh, Jimmy, I give up.

337
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:48,430
Psyche, it's about to be 54 grand

338
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,589
and I'm about to hide in these chairs.

339
00:10:50,589 --> 00:10:52,094
Think he's gonna look for me down here?

340
00:10:52,094 --> 00:10:53,664
This is pretty risky.

341
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:54,914
- See ya later.

342
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,343
- How graceful was that
shuffle though? I mean, c'mon.

343
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:01,600
- We have a dilemma.

344
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,300
We have one hour left
with this giant building

345
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,770
and there's four people that remain.

346
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,240
I think we need to devise a plan.

347
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,140
What if we told 'em all
to go to a single floor.

348
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:12,080
To the four of you that remain,
we have about an hour left.

349
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,510
We need to spice some things up.

350
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,360
So, we're gonna limit
the range to two floors.

351
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,570
You have 10 minutes to
get to floor two and three

352
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,325
and you need to hide on those two floors.

353
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,011
- They just told me to move floors.

354
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,370
So, we are on the second floor right now.

355
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,560
We're actually gonna go back
up to that third floor spot

356
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,470
in the theater.

357
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,270
- So, Jimmy's havin' a
hard time finding us,

358
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,270
so we have to move.

359
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,420
- I found my new hiding spot,
floor three, in the theater.

360
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,600
It's very, very dark back
here. They could overlook me.

361
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,470
I hope they do.

362
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,303
- We can do this.

363
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:40,160
- I believe in us.

364
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,370
- I don't. These people
are really good at hiding.

365
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,360
- Let's go back to the theater.

366
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,555
Someone's definitely in here.

367
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,620
(suspenseful music)

368
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,504
- Dang it.

369
00:11:48,504 --> 00:11:51,337
- Nooooooo. Noooooooooo. Nooooooo.

370
00:11:53,297 --> 00:11:54,500
- I'm so disappointed.

371
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,900
- That was so good spot, though.

372
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,994
Hey, it looks like you got
some You Tooz back there.

373
00:11:57,994 --> 00:11:58,827
- Oh yeah, I got Chandler.

374
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,560
- You know what the best thing to do

375
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,013
with Chandler's You Tooz is?

376
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,973
- Wow.

377
00:12:04,973 --> 00:12:06,070
- Buy my You Tooz, it's better.

378
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,903
- He said it.

379
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:07,736
- I was in the chest.

380
00:12:07,736 --> 00:12:09,147
- You
- Yeah, you called it

381
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:10,610
- I said it was Jacob.

382
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,970
- We have a new friend for you.

383
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,303
- Oh, noooooooo.

384
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,921
- Three more. Let's scare 'em off.

385
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,088
(screams)

386
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:21,773
- oh, there's Chris
again. What a loud boy.

387
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,510
- We found Jacob, so
only three of you remain.

388
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,690
- Jimmy just said on the radio

389
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,250
that it's only three of us remaining.

390
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,870
I think we've got a
really good hiding spot.

391
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,668
It's kinda like behind some blinds.

392
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,530
- Somebody just ran from me

393
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,680
but I couldn't see who it was

394
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,213
all I saw was shoes (beep).

395
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,046
- I'm comin' I'm comin'.

396
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,296
- Oh, noooooooo

397
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:39,646
- What? Who'd you find?

398
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:40,668
- No, Marcus.

399
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:42,110
I found you Marcus.

400
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,173
- Marcus, no.

401
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,211
- He literally goes Marcus, I'm sorry,

402
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:49,020
and then I just see you just bolted.

403
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,916
We found a new member, c'mon in.

404
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,249
- Nooooooooooooo

405
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:54,920
- Oh my God.

406
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,673
- I just wanna win my first challenge.

407
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:57,670
- Wipe your tears, son.

408
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,220
- Dude, you almost had
it. It's not my fault.

409
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,660
It's just the name of the game.

410
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,610
Your hair's so soft.

411
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,443
There's two people left.

412
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:04,710
- Jake Weddle and Ben Malone.

413
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,430
We found Marcus, which
means two of you remain.

414
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:09,370
Mister Weddle, Mister Ben,

415
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,867
you two are now competing for $50,000.

416
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:15,336
- I hope I win this thing. I really do.

417
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,610
- I am not getting found.
I am taking that money.

418
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,210
- Now, since there's only two of you left,

419
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,260
you both have to migrate
to the third floor.

420
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,000
First one found loses and the
other one will get $50,000.

421
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,270
- They're confining it to the third floor.

422
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,103
I'm on the third floor,

423
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:28,540
so I don't have to move anywhere.

424
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,263
- My battery's almost
dead. I'm on the move.

425
00:13:30,263 --> 00:13:33,330
I am out in the open.
I am exposed right now.

426
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,880
- We are now ascending from
the second floor to the third,

427
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,710
where Ben and Jake reside.

428
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,540
Let's start off here.
We're gonna do a sweep.

429
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,584
We're gonna hit every room
and work our way around.

430
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:47,610
(suspenseful music)

431
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,596
- Oh, I see him.

432
00:13:48,596 --> 00:13:50,263
Weddle, no I saw you.

433
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,749
- Go that way. I'm goin' this way.

434
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,823
- Weddle no.

435
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:55,858
- Weddle.

436
00:13:55,858 --> 00:13:57,307
- I've known all along. I'm so tired.

437
00:13:57,307 --> 00:13:59,544
I haven't eaten since three p.m.

438
00:13:59,544 --> 00:14:00,520
(laughs)

439
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,060
- Jake, your fly is also down

440
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,720
not to add insult to injury.

441
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,220
- Let's not tell Ben (laughs).

442
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,460
- Should we just go
home, forget about Ben?

443
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,980
- Yeah, I think we should
probably just head out.

444
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,813
- What up?

445
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:12,378
(laughs)
dude, that's a good spot.

446
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:13,476
- Ben, come on out

447
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,082
(laughs)

448
00:14:15,082 --> 00:14:16,877
- How good is that spot?

449
00:14:16,877 --> 00:14:21,877
The winner of the $50,000
game of hide and seek is Ben.

450
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,330
(group cheers)

451
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,640
We need to let Weddle into prison.

452
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,540
- To where I belong,

453
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,788
this is what prison's like kids.

454
00:14:29,788 --> 00:14:30,790
(laughs)

455
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,850
- All right Ben, now I'm
gonna awkwardly hand you

456
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,376
the money in front of everyone.

457
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:35,209
(applause)

458
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,930
Maybe you should buy
them some stuff, I dunno.

459
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:39,002
Subscribe. I hope you enjoyed. Goodbye.

460
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:40,093
- It was such a good time

461
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:42,370
and now I'm gonna be able
to actually give my family

462
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,177
and everything a good Christmas, you know?

463
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:45,010
I'm really excited.

464
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,360
- Well, Ben, congratulations.

465
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,193
Enjoy your 50 grand.

466
00:14:47,193 --> 00:14:48,282
- Thanks, man.
