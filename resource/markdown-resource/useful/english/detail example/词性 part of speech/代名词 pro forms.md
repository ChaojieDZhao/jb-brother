代名词是用来代替名词片语以避免重複的一种词类。例如:
1. __The dog__ ate __the bone__.
2. __He__ liked __it__.

句 2 中的 he 与 it 就是代名词，分别代替句 1 中的名词片语 the dog 与 the bone 以避免重复。the dog 与 the bone 称为先行词(antecedents)。

# 代名词与先行词人称须一致
- __People__ often think that __our__ difficulties are unique. (不佳)
- __People__ often think that __their__ difficulties are unique.(好)
- __We__ often think that __our__ difficulties are unique.(好)

# 代名词与先行词单复数须一致
- If the campaign succeeds in raising __huge sums__, the sponsors will devote __it__ all to disaster relief. __(误)__
(如果宣传运动成功募得钜款，主办单位将全数用于救灾。)
- If the campaign succeeds in raising __huge sums__, the sponsors will devote __them__ all to disaster relief.__(好)__
- If the campaign succeeds in raising __a huge sum__, the sponsors will devote __it__ all to disaster relief.__(好)__

- When __a teacher__ takes __his__ students on a field trip, he is fully responsible and must bring every one of them safely back to school with __him__. 男
- When __a teacher__ takes __her__ students on a field trip, she is fully responsible and must bring every one of them safely back to school with __her__.女
