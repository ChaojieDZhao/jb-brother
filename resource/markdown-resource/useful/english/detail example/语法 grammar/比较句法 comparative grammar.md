英文的修饰语包括形容词与副词，都有比较级与最高级的变化。以连接词 as 或 than 连 接的比较级句子，不论是形容词还是副词的比较级，都可以视為主要子句加从属子句构成的 复句结构:从属连接词 than 或 as 引导的子句是副词子句。

# 大於、小於、等於

## 大于

- Unit 3 is longer than Unit 4.
- 1. Unit 3 is long.
- 2. Unit 4 is not so long.
- Unit 3 is longer than Unit 4 (is).

## 小於

要表示「小於」的关係，可以採用 less ... than 或 not so ... as 这两种句法。

- Unit 3 is less difficult than Unit 4.
- Unit 3 is less difficult than Unit 4 (is).

## 等於

「等於」的关係，可以用 as ... as 来连接

# 準关係代名词

- His father left him more money [than he can ever spend].

# 定冠词的判断

## 如果是补语位置的形容词，不需要冠词
- Yellowstone is crowded.
- Yellowstone is most crowded in summer.

## 表语位置需要
- Yellowstone is a crowded scenic spot.
- Yellowstone is the most crowded of the state’s scenic spots.

## 只要是具有指示性，比较级也可能要加定冠词
- John is the shorter of the twins.

# That 和 those 的使用

比较级的句子要求对称工整，包括比较的对象在内也要对称。亦即，「谁和谁比」不能 搞错。

- My car is bigger than you. (误)
- My car is bigger than yours.
- Cars made in Japan are better than those made in Korea.

# 比较句法的平行对称要求

# 比较句法的省略

# 比较的倒装

# 比较点的观察
